# Root ReadMe Title

Some readme text!

In truth, this should list out recent posts (5-10 most recent?). I will also have an About section (with photo).

The footer will list out the categories and tags. To the right of that will be the About me blerb (maybe just a snippet with social links and a link to a more robust page?)

Sidebars on regular pages should be about related posts (same category or tags?)

Check out the [Tests!](/tests/)
