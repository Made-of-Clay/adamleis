# Adam Leis Personal Website

This will just be a dumping ground now for me. My digital presence... something for the
feds to use to profile me better `;)`

Home/landing page will be large-block, single-page layout with the following:
- Welcome/About info (brief) w/ my photo
- Portfolio link (`portfolio.adamleis.com`) & any recent posts
- Blog link (`blog.adamleis.com`) & any recent posts
- Contact form - uses wp mail? decide later

Header bar links to each section and updates (maybe w/ cool animation) when new area
is entered.

Use Vuex w/ hashes to jump to area of page quickly

Probably from portfolio, link to any extra projects (e.g. Marvel calculator, topic study, ...)

Link to social media where relevant (Facebook, LinkedIn) - update where necessary

## Technical requirements
I'll use the following setup for the site

### Front-end

- Vue.js
- Vue Router
- Fetch API

Vuex probably won't be necessary as it's just one component? Maybe one layer (i.e. parent-child)

### Back-end

- WordPress (headless - admin)
- WordPress REST API (serves data)

Make sure to set up WordPress with solid security, stripped down dependencies,
and optimization plugins/code for queries

## Design Ideas
Sections will be large blocks of content (scrolling is fact of life today); easily responsive
Large photos (woo responsive image opportunity!)
Favor light background w/ forest-y greens & maybe some blues?
Very minor use of rich, bright red color too; just don't miscommunicate "error!"
Header bar/nav could use the green(s) and have a cool geometric, subtle node-grid background (think Codepen canvas node experiments)
SUPER cool header bar would be canvas bg w/ animating nodes like in Codepen (give props to who you borrow from)
    make it as a component for easy portability

## Blog & Portfolio
Treat as separate git project? Reason for this is use of subdomains

### Portfolio
Single-page, no apparent section changes
List of entries, thumbnails per entry
Click thumbnail expands to fullscreen view w/ nav from there too (and details)
Maybe brief blerb on entry to the side?
Search/filter available too

### Blog
SPA w/ area navigation (categories, tags, search, recent posts, specific post)
Use Vuex/Router combo (w/ history state if easy enough)
Basically make WP blog w/ Vue front-end
