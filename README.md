This Astro-built dev blog is a WIP, as all profession developers' sites are. I'm sure I'll iterate on this several times, but I really just need to start with a very simple site to get things going. Too often, I fall prey to my own tendency to never finish a project because I keep iterating. Instead, I need to get one version out before starting another. There are things about this build that I don't like, but that's the point.
