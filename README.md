I finally finished the Astro.js version of my site. It's been a fun learning experience. I'll incrementally keep improving upon the site as I go along, and I'll *eventually* probably rebuild it again, but the major benefit is that the content will be in markdown, and therefore hypothetically easier to transfer.

Woot!
