I finally finished the Astro.js version of my site. It's been a fun learning experience. I'll incrementally keep improving upon the site as I go along, and I'll *eventually* probably rebuild it again, but the major benefit is that the content will be in markdown, and therefore hypothetically easier to transfer.

Woot!

## Firebase Hosting Deployment

If `firebase` isn't globally installed in your node environment, run the following first ([initially recorded here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#windows-npm)):

`npm i -g firebase-tools`

If it's already installed but only locally, prefix the deployment script with `npx `.

Then to deployâ€¦

`firebase deploy --only hosting`
