# The personal website of Adam Leis

This website currently acts as a kind of interactive resume and adds more details than could be covered in my resume. I have further plans for performance improvements and additions (more interactivity, cloud functions for handling contact emails, setting up Docker for consistent environments, etc...).

A critical lesson that I have learned while in web is that there is always more to work on. This coincides with a valuable lesson from my time in art school: there are no finished projects, only abandoned ones.

## Build Setup

This source was originally built using an older version of `vue-cli`. The following notes have been preserved for personal reference.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader). (This may be out-dated, I have not investigated it.)
