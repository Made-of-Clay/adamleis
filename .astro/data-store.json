The UX/UI design team worked to build the initial components in Figma, and I worked closely with them to implement the components using the Vue.js library.\r\n\r\nWe discussed whether to use Bootstrap or Tailwind (which was gaining popularity at the time). Given (1) Tailwind's youth and (2) our existing ubiquitous usage of Bootstrap, we ended up staying with Bootstrap. They are the only two runtime dependencies that GravITI has.\r\n\r\n## Purpose\r\n\r\n\"Why not use an existing UI library like Vuetify, Quasar, or PrimeVue?\" Well, we *did* use PrimeVue for some early projects. It had the benefit of theming and existing functionality. It was a close call to either use PrimeVue or roll our own library. As for the other options, Quasar and Vuetify required too much buy-in for our purposes, and we have many legacy application in transition where we wanted to use the library at various states of transition without needing to update *everything*.\r\n\r\n**The reason to choose an in-house solution ultimately came down to an interest in control.** We wanted full control over the functionality, design, and roadmap of the library. I'm uncertain if I would have pushed for PrimeVue had I then the knowledge I have now. 🤔 One clear benefit has been the learning process along the way, i.e., how to configure tooling to generate a bundle usable in bundled projects and at runtime. In retrospect, the experience with Storybook has been valuable as well.\r\n\r\n## Design Details\r\n\r\nThe designs were done in Figma, so I spent a lot of time looking through the elements and their associated styles. That meant grabbing values from Figma, but it also meant communicating with the designers when some details were complicated. For example, Bootstrap uses units divisible by 16 to play with the browser's default setting of `16px === 1rem`. The designers were in the habit of base-5 units though. After some conversations and decision making, we ended up following the base-16 units. \r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, there were many other issues to work through as the project evolved, but that's a story for another day.\r\n\r\n## Technical Details\r\n\r\nThe following is the current (as of Nov. 20, 2024) tech stack used within the GravITI library:\r\n\r\n- Vue.js (love that data reactivity)\r\n- Bootstrap\r\n- Vite (it began using Vue-CLI, but the transition was made as Vite matured into its v1 releases)\r\n- Jest (it's on the roadmap to switch to Vitest)\r\n- Storybook (more on this below)\r\n\r\n### Storybook\r\n\r\nWhen I began, Storybook became a very helpful tool for getting my components into a robust testing UI space and offered a lot in the way of out-of-the-box documentation. This was a great boon for my progress in advancing the library, which was (and still is) often a political game with the business units of the company. Those close to the technical portions of projects understand the value to keeping the library up-to-date. Those further away understandably… don't care.\r\n\r\nIn one of the minor version updates though, I noticed *a lot* of dependencies come down for Storybook. They were React-heavy packages (understandably given the underlying architecture is React). Many TypeScript type definitions came down as well. Here's where my problems began.\r\n\r\nSome of the `@types` definitions for Storybook may have been helpful for Storybook itself, and even React for relevant projects, but my Vue project types kept getting stomped on. Perhaps I could have contributed to the community work and figured out the solution for others in a similar situation, but the reality is (1) I have trouble selling explicit community support work or (2) working it into the other dev work to justify its inclusion in my task work.\r\n\r\nMaybe that's a \"blah blah blah, excuses\" thing, but it's what's real in my current experience. All in all, while Storybook has been a great help, this and some other issues have been complicating factors.\r\n\r\n## Wrap up\r\n\r\nUltimately, the project continues to be one of the more challenging and rewarding projects I've worked on at ITI. The foundational level they play in our applications means diligence and care must be taken. There's a large bull whip effect that happens when changes are made at that low a level of UI development.

The purpose of this site is to provide an online portal for taking the written portion of the state driver's examination. Users register their information, often paying online, and take the exam all online. Test results, emails, and a strictly controlled user flow through the website are all part of the experience.\r\n\r\n**One of the more interesting aspects is the facial recognition feature during the exam.** A user allows access to his/her webcam, takes a control photo of a neutral expression of their face, and that photo is used as the control for facial matches throughout the exam. Photos are taken randomly throughout the exam and compared against the control photo. Any anomalies will cause the user to incur infractions that are tracked for auditing purposes when deemed necessary. This is one of my favorite features of the site.\r\n\r\nOne of the challenging aspects of the site is its architecture. It is a classic MVC website, so the front-end optimizations/updates I've made have been working within that paradigm instead of using a single-page application. This isn't generally a problem as many pages are simple text/disclaimer pages or require little to no JS. (Why load Vue.js or other libraries when vanilla JS will do?)\r\n\r\nOther more feature-rich pages do require a special touch. In addition to more interactive needs for some pages, each state has customizations and settings that can be adjusted on the site. The list of features offered has grown in four years, and many bitter lessons have been learned along the way. This is inevitable for any project with similar demands, and ensuring backwards compatibility and proper abstractions are part of the challenge. When it's done right though, it's very rewarding.\r\n\r\n## Web Applications\r\n\r\nAlong with the driver testing projects are a number of support admin applications. Some states request tools for managing Translators that can be provided on the fly for test-takers with English as a second language. Others may require customized driving routes (see the *SkillsTo Drive* project description below). There are many nuanced needs that arise when dealing with so many different states and jurisdictions. (ITI services many US states as well as several Canadian territories.) **We have built a lot of helper applications for our clients.**\r\n\r\nEach of these applications follows the single-page application architecture (in contrast to *KnowTo Drive Online*'s multi-page application structure, i.e. a classic website). Minimally, a Vue UI (using Vite as its bundler and our GravITI UI library) runs the front-end while one or more APIs provide data on the back-end. It's pretty standard stuff. Customizations are less common in these applications but not absent.\r\n\r\n## Others\r\n\r\nOther applications I've worked on stretch into less conventional web application spaces. As part of a collaborative effort with a third-party agency who were helping us in a very busy time, our team built a new app called *SkillsTo Drive*. This app is used on the road during the driver's test where the instructor uses a tablet to inspect the vehicle and keep track of driving test points for a particular route.\r\n\r\nThe *SkillsTo Drive* app is built in [*React Native for Windows*](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows). My opinion of *React Native for Windows* has been mixed. React Native as a core concept is a great way to help web developers break into the native/mobile app spaces. While the performance will never be quite as good as a native app in their typical languages, it lets developers build apps quickly in a space they'd otherwise take longer to build. *React Native for Windows* in particular has not seen the frequency of stable updates we had hoped when we joined the third-party team in its development.\r\n\r\nAll the same, it's a great product to offer state driver testing offices. (Personally, I'd be very interested in building a Progressive Web App version some day, but it's unlikely that proposal will gain traction while the current app is still relatively young.)\r\n\r\n## Coda\r\n\r\nThis is just a brief dip into the kinds of projects I've been working on with the great ITI team. There are still so many great opportunities and ideas, some of which are on the horizon. The greatest challenge has been finding the right timing for many of the projects and improvements we see daily (consequences of working so closely with them).\r\n\r\nAs ever, the tech world offers no shortage of fascinating new topics to study.","src/content/work/iti-projects.md","fe53f6e82822b6ba",{"html":57,"metadata":58},"\u003Ch1 id=\"iti-projects\">ITI Projects\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>I’ve written a bit more in-depth about my work on \u003Ca href=\"/work/iti-graviti\">ITI’s GravITI UI Library\u003C/a>, but this is about my broader body of work at ITI.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"website\">Website\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The first project I began working on is the \u003Cem>KnowTo Drive Online\u003C/em> website.

In that conversation, DHH is asked about his experience using [Neovim](https://neovim.io/). I've often considered trying to learn it better and actually using it as a tool. Prime hypes it really well, and I admit that sways me.\r\n\r\nMy most recent itch was not from Prime though, it was something DHH said. Or better, it was how he described learning Neovim. He likened it to doing a \"sick combo\" in Street Fighter. **This idea of gamifying the use of Neovim might be what I need to get me started.**\r\n\r\n**My main reason for not jumping in yet** is the known time requirement needed to really get started. Configuring everything seems a daunting task. I'm not alone in this, I'm sure. My work is already so \"go go go\" trying to get projects done; my personal projects are allocated so little precious time that I don't want to be slow there. It's tough to get started. I believe though, once I get started and just *start* trying to use it, that'll be the bump I need to pass to succeed.\r\n\r\n> Mindset shifts make all the difference.\r\n\r\nBack to gamifying learning Neovim, if I think of the motions as game combos, would that make it easier, dare I say *more fun*, to learn it effectively? Mindset shifts make all the difference. Maybe this would be enough to get started with the motions, at least.\r\n\r\nGiven how much I type *just* for work, learning Neovim and getting really good at it has obvious value. The niche bragging rights of being proficient with it is also cool. I'm frequently wrestling with the ROI though. I suppose if I type 5 solid hours a day on average, and if I can be more efficient at that 5 hours, maybe that'd be enough.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of just *learning* something is also enough to be enticing. Couple that with the difficulty level of learning and the leveling-up that happens naturally, and it's *really* enticing.

Nothing I'll cover here is new or revelatory, but you're still reading, so let's get to it.\r\n\r\nWhatever else it might be, **the story of the Fall is a metaphor that applies as much to us today as in the human genesis.** To be clear, I'm not calling into question or even addressing if I think the story is grounded in history. (I do, but that's not what I'm focusing on here.) I'm proposing that the Fall is an archetype of human behavior that still plays out today.\r\n\r\n## The Details\r\n\r\nLet's summarize the story briefly, though it's short enough to read in its entirety in Genesis 2 & 3. \r\n\r\n- God creates Adam (literally the \"human/man,\" like how we say \"mankind\" or \"humanity\").\r\n- God instructs \"the man\" (i.e. Adam) to eat from *anything* in the Garden *except* for \"the tree of knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die\" (Gen. 2:17 NIV).\r\n- Later, God creates \"the woman\" (Gen. 2:21-22), who is not named \"Eve\" until after the Fall (Gen. 3:20), interestingly.\r\n- The serpent (who is only associated with Satan in the New Testament; perhaps a later developed idea) convinces Even to eat the fruit (while Adam sat idly by; another often-overlooked detail; Gen. 3:6), who also gives some to her husband in the same sitting.\r\n- Their eyes \"were opened\" and they noticed their vulnerability (nakedness) and tried to cover it (another metaphor for hiding their shame; sidebar: try to understand nakedness in the cultural context rather than our own to appreciate what's being communicated.)\r\n\r\n## The Interpretation\r\n\r\nThe man/human/Adam is created, given instructions (another way to say it, given \"the Law\" or *torah*) on how to live in the Garden, given work, then given a helper (not a servant, but genuinely a helpmate; someone to strengthen Adam and help enable him in his God-given work). *Then*, God's instructions are challenged, misinterpreted/misquoted (by Eve and not corrected by Adam), and ignored.\r\n\r\nHere's the crux of the issue: **eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil is akin to rejecting God's instructions and going one's own way.**\r\n\r\nThe expression \"good and evil\" is an idiot to express two extremes of the moral spectrum, good and evil, and everything in between. This is common in Hebrew literature: \"the heavens and the earth\" from the perspective of pre-scientific astronomy means \"the very top to the very bottom;\" \"as far as the east to the west\" means the furthest extremes on this physical plain; and of course, \"good and evil\" means \"all moral actions.\" Another way to more concisely express the idea in modern English would be \"the tree of moral knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n> Eating from the tree of moral knowledge is akin to rejecting God's instructions and going one's own way.\r\n\r\nGod instructs humanity (Adam and by extension Eve) to partake in all the activities available, but don't determine for yourselves what is morally right and wrong; that's God's job. (In apologetic discussions of the problem of evil/pain/suffering, moral law is not something God declares, nor something co-existing with God that God follows as the Euthyphro dilemma would suggest; moral law extends from God's own character).\r\n\r\nTo restate and rephrase: **eating from the tree of moral knowledge is akin to rejecting God's instructions and going one's own way.**\r\n\r\nWhen (any) human eats from that tree, the person declares, \"I know better than God's instruction on this matter,\" and effectively asserts moral superiority *over* God. It's fundamentally an act of pride and self-glorification/deification. Now the weight of the sin/fault is clear.\r\n\r\n## The Solution\r\n\r\nIt took a long time for the solution to become clear. When Jesus lived and worked on earth, he followed God's instructions. His life became a model for all \"Adams\" (and Eves). Much more can be said about the nature of cultural and ritual sacrifices, the atonement of sins, and the role Jesus played there, but again, that's another topic for another day.\r\n\r\n\"Jesus is the answer\" as the saying goes. Specifically, trusting that Jesus can and will save you from your own \"fruit-eating\" and help reunite you to the affectionate Creator Who strolled with us through the Garden.

Similar to how [Aristotle's four causes](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-causality/#FourCaus) attempt to provide a mental model for a deeper understanding of some thing, this model for thinking about creative ventures strives to better understand creativity by describing it more clearly.\r\n\r\nMore posts will follow in explaining and challenging the ideas I'll propose here. For now, an explanation of my mental model.\r\n\r\n## A Tripartite Model of Creativity\r\n\r\nThree terms are commonly use to describe various creative works: art, craft, and design. I've never liked the ambiguity between \"arts and crafts\" or \"art and design.\" In my undergrad, where I focused on digital arts as fine art, I worked near and with designers a lot, as well as artists. When one of my artist peers claimed abstract are was more design than art to him, it got me thinking.\r\n\r\nWhat do I think \"art\" is? What is \"design?\" What is a craft, or what does it mean to craft something?\r\n\r\n### Craft\r\n\r\nBeginning with \"craft,\" in this model, **the craft of a creative work is the technical \"how-to\" in making the work**. In drawing, this means choosing the right material, e.g. graphite, charcoal, conte crayon, colored pencils, etc. That can also include shading techniques like blending, hatching, cross-hatching, pointillism, etc.\r\n\r\n> These are hands-on skills that anyone can learn technically.\r\n\r\nThis is not limited to 2d work like painting and drawing. It can describe 3d art like pottery or sculpting. How is clay shaped or scored to be combined? How is a mold made to cast into other materials? These are hands-on skills that anyone can learn technically.\r\n\r\nStretch the idea further. How do couples dance the Tango or salsa? How does an entrepreneur set up and start a new company? How do writers put words to paper (digital or analog)?\r\n\r\nA creative work's craft is all about *how* something is made.\r\n\r\n### Design\r\n\r\n**The \"design\" part of this model is about aesthetics.** What makes a painting look good? What is it about a great logo that makes it so iconic? How is a musical piece composed to illicit an emotional response in the listener? What flavors of a culinary dish combine in just the right way to maximize each food's flavor?\r\n\r\nIf craft answers, \"*how's* it made?\", then design answers, \"*what* makes it appealing?\"\r\n\r\nDesign should engage at least one, but ideally more, of the five senses. It is empirical in nature. People tend to use \"design\" to refer to visuals, but there's no reason for such a restriction.\r\n\r\n### Art\r\n\r\nNow the big one filled with the most contention. What is \"art\" in this model? Art is made when a creative work is imbued with meaning.\r\n\r\nArt answers, \"*why* was it made?\" Alternatively, art enters the equation when nuances are added for very particular reasons. **Art is the purpose behind a work that offers purpose and meaning.**\r\n\r\nDa Vinci's *Virtuvian Man* is simply an anatomical study drawing done in pen and ink on water color paper (craft). Add to that the careful proportions and interesting placement of the overlapping arms and legs within the square and circle, and you have an interesting composition (design). However, once you consider the symbolism of circles and squares, you start to find deeper meaning (art).\r\n\r\nThis also means there are many creative works that would not qualify as art. The Hobby Lobby paint by numbers are excellent examples of crafts, because it instructs the painter on how to paint and what colors to use. There's an inherent design to the original creator of the stencil, but the consumer who paints at home and hangs a nice, homemade painting in her kitchen has done neither art nor design.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, this also means there may be a lot of art without a great focus on masterful craftsmanship. More examples of each will be explored in future posts exploring the merits and shortcomings.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nI've been testing this tripartite model of creativity for a number of years on-and-off. So far, it's held up to the passing scrutiny raised. With more serious investigation, I may find weaknesses or caveats that need addressed, but for now, it holds up.\r\n\r\n> **tl:dr;** in creative works, the \"craft\" is *how* something is made technically, the \"design\" is *what* makes it aesthetically appealing, and the \"art\" is *why* something was made.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? What variations of creativity can you think of that this model describes well? What examples fail? Let me know on social media.\r\n\r\nKeep thinkin', folks.","src/content/blog/creativity-series.md","94b7549d396593d9",{"html":309,"metadata":310},"\u003Ch1 id=\"creativity-series\">Creativity Series\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Over the years, I’ve been developing \u003Ca href=\"https://xkcd.com/927/\" title=\"Because who doesn&#x27;t like standards?\">my own mental model\u003C/a> for conceptualizing creative work and how to analyze them.

This is very difficult work.\r\n\r\n> \"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.\" - Albert Einstein\r\n\r\nI've iterated over many ideas and implementations on how to make this work. JSON-heavy configuration files, database-stored settings fetched at runtime, combinations of both, low-code config files like HTML partials that are dropped into the `head` when applicable, etc.\r\n\r\n## Vision Forward\r\n\r\nHaving tried, failed, refined, and retried all of these approaches, I've come to painfully appreciate the great and powerful value of the custom website/web page builder UI. [Wix](https://www.wix.com/), [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/), [Webflow](https://webflow.com/), etc. are all excellent examples of this (and many more exist).\r\n\r\nI've been dreaming up a custom page builder for our own products as well. One significant challenge that presents itself is making the time for R&D. While the value is recognized, there's still enough work to slow my brainstorming and experimenting. That also means, in order to accomplish this R&D, I must do it on my own time. Not a terrible solution, but difficult to implement for similar reasons. (I'd like to be a present husband and father 😁)\r\n\r\n## Technical Challenges\r\n\r\nSome additional technical challenges that I've been considering: SSR setup, integration with Vue for reactive UIs, defining intuitive data contexts (e.g. Pinia store, other flux-like stores), and defining a light-enough data schema for storing the definitions.\r\n\r\n### SSR Setup\r\n\r\nA modern front-end tool like Vue.js (or React, or Svelte, etc.) seems the right tool for the job here, at least regarding the interactive building part (\"Edit\" mode). However, actually rendering the page (\"View\" mode) should be done on the server for better page load times and, if applicable, better SEO indexing.\r\n\r\nIn many of the dashboard apps I tend to build at ITI (and previous places of employment), SEO has rarely been a requirement. They're almost always behind a login, so no bots can reach them by design.\r\n\r\nImproving page rendering is always a good practice, much like RWD. It's best when we just bake the practice into our development habits. However, I've been in an unhealthy space with this regard. We want fast page load times, certainly, but we often settle for \"good enough.\" Some days I'm frustrated by this, but admittedly, other days it's quite fine. I cannot imagine this is unique to me.\r\n\r\n[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React) and [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/) (Vue) are great options for SSR projects. So much comes baked in. Depending on tech stack requirements, either are great options.\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach would be to use whatever existing server-side languages are available. Go, PHP, Python, C#, Ruby, etc. can take and interpret the defined page schema and render static HTML. The only downside to choosing any of these tools is balancing it with whatever reactivity and hydration needs the front-end has with the rendered markup. Not a blocker, but devs must be aware of the hurdle.\r\n\r\n### Integration with Vue for Reactivity\r\n\r\nI'm a huge fan of Vue.js. When I started dipping into the front-end soup of options, Angular 2 had just come out, and React was a new kid. Vue was even newer (still in v1 at the time, but v2 was just about to drop).\r\n\r\nI had tried Angular.js (v1) and liked it, but the shift to v2 was jarring, and I was very new to TypeScript still. I also had been resisting build systems on the front-end for a while. I only just started using Grunt/Gulp; my reception was tepid. On to React.\r\n\r\nJSX was immediately distasteful. I really didn't care for mixing HTML into JS. (I would later come to appreciate what it was accomplishing and warmed to the tech.) I also wasn't thrilled with how integral the build step was for new adopters. I bookmarked it as a maybe and moved to Vue.js\r\n\r\nIn Vue.js, I was thrilled that my two biggest complaints were not near requirements. **I didn't *need* a build step**, and I could keep my markup, styles, and logic separate. It wouldn't take me long to get into the single-file component \".vue\" pattern and end up adopting build systems, but this was the warm invitation I needed.\r\n\r\nSince then, I've guzzled the Vue.js kool-aid and loved component-based front-end UI architectures. I eventually returned to React and appreciated better what it was doing, but I still don't like CSS-in-JS approaches…\r\n\r\nThat said, **I want Vue-flavored data reactivity in my page builder.** This presents a challenging hurdle. It's not difficult to bind attributes to a given HTML element or Vue component. `v-bind` does so trivially. Binding events is a bit more complicated. How will the function be defined and included in the proper context for `v-on` to bind it?\r\n\r\n### Reactive Data Context\r\n\r\nSimilarly, how will this context be defined? Will it be a global store a la Pinia? Can it be scoped to the runtime component alone? Should I use provide/inject to define and access functions? Such are the trials & tribulations of client-side state management and event handling.\r\n\r\nOne WIP idea is to provide a way to define Pinia stores (or even custom-defined stores with `ref`, `computed`, and `reactive`) that are accessible for any given page. This leads to the question, \"How will the user who builds the page define those stores?\" Another UI would be required to support Pinia store-building in a no/low-code UI.","src/content/blog/super-dynamic-apps.md","a1a3860f0198aab2",{"html":372,"metadata":373},"\u003Ch1 id=\"super-dynamic-apps\">Super Dynamic Apps\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>In my current work, I’m responsible for making our web apps &#x26; sites highly configurable so that each client can (mostly) custom tailor our products to their wants/needs.

Craft, design, and art are all important elements of creativity, and they can work together to create something that is both beautiful and meaningful.\r\n>\r\n> **Craft** is the technical process by which some work is created. It involves the skills and knowledge that are necessary to create a work of art, such as the ability to use tools and materials, or the ability to follow instructions. Craft is important because it allows artists to express their ideas in a clear and concise way.\r\n>\r\n> **Design** is the process of making some work aesthetically pleasing. It involves the use of color, shape, form, and texture to create a work that is visually appealing. Design is important because it helps to communicate the artist's message in a way that is both visually and emotionally engaging.\r\n>\r\n> **Art** is the process of imbuing some work with meaning or communicating a message. It involves the use of symbols, metaphors, and other devices to create a work that is both intellectually and emotionally stimulating. Art is important because it allows artists to explore the human condition and to share their insights with others.\r\n>\r\n> The three-part framework for thinking of creativity can be used to understand any type of creative work, from painting and sculpture to music and literature. It is a helpful way to think about the different elements that contribute to a creative work, and it can help us to appreciate the skill and artistry that goes into creating something beautiful and meaningful.\r\n>\r\n> Here are some strengths and weaknesses of the three-part framework for thinking of creativity:\r\n>\r\n> **Strengths**:\r\n>\r\n> The framework is simple and easy to understand.\r\n> It can be used to understand any type of creative work.\r\n> It can help us to appreciate the skill and artistry that goes into creating something beautiful and meaningful.\r\n>\r\n> **Weaknesses**:\r\n>\r\n> The framework may be too simplistic for some types of creative work.\r\n>\r\n> It may not be able to account for all of the factors that contribute to creativity.\r\n>\r\n> It may be difficult to apply the framework to creative work that is not traditionally artistic.\r\n>\r\n> Overall, the three-part framework for thinking of creativity is a helpful tool for understanding the different aspects of creative work. However, it is important to be aware of its limitations.\r\n>\r\n> Here are some tips on how to get your idea to more people in a constructive way:\r\n>\r\n> Start by identifying your audience.

This series is designed to help me **test my assumptions and the utility of the framework** in a variety of creative disciplines.\r\n\r\nIt will begin by being applied to more traditional forms of creativity like painting, music, and writing. As the framework is tested and refined, more examples will be considered in less-traditional fields of creativity (e.g. software development, entrepreneurship, or science).\r\n\r\n## The Framework\r\n\r\nThe framework is composed of three parts: craft, design, and art. Much like Aristotle's various frameworks, e.g. [the four causes](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-causality/) or [modes of persuasion](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-rhetoric/), this framework's goal is to provide a multifaceted way to look at creative works in a holistic manner.\r\n\r\n> This framework's goal is to provide a multifaceted way to look at creative works in a holistic manner.\r\n\r\nHere is the initial framework:\r\n\r\n- **craft**: the process of how to make something given certain materials or processes\r\n- **design**: the process of organizing the components of the work in an aesthetically pleasing manner\r\n- **art**: the process of imbuing the work with meaning, purpose, and/or value\r\n\r\n### Craft\r\n\r\n**The process of how to make something given certain materials or processes.**\r\n\r\nThe combo of \"arts and crafts\" conjures mental images of Hobby Lobby and Jo-Ann Fabrics. A looser definition of the term \"art\" will include some paintings for sale, and several books on Bob Ross _plein air_ painting instruction books.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm proposing this only scratches (pun intended) at the craft of creative works. It deals with the _how-to_ of painting, drawing, sculpting, and modeling.\r\n\r\nThis is not derisive towards craft. It is an essential part of generating creative work. Without the craft, there is nothing to observe.\r\n\r\nPainters need to know how to mix paint. Musicians need to know how to finger their instrument. Writers need to know how to write legibly and occasionally rhyme words in a poem. Technical implementation details in _how something is made_ are quite important.\r\n\r\n### Design\r\n\r\n**The process of organizing the components of the work in an aesthetically pleasing manner.**\r\n\r\nGiven craft works out the technical details of _making_ some creative work, design is what makes it appealing and pleasurable to observe. How are the essential parts organized to make the work enjoyable? What does that mean?\r\n\r\nIn visual creative works, strong design means the visual components, shapes, and elements are composed in an appealing way. Their placement in the layout of the composition is intentional and facilitates what the creator intended. Scale can be used to indicate relative size to other elements or relative size to the observer. Color theory may be used to indicate mood, relationships of elements; red can be used to anger _and_ love.\r\n\r\nIn musical works, melody, harmony, and rhythm can create coherent and aesthetically pleasing songs. The way elements or instruments of the song interact with each other can create pleasing or dissonant combinations, which might reflect and underlying story appealingly. (Note that \"aesthetically pleasing\" might seem unattractive on its own, but the elements might contrast other elements in appeasing ways.)\r\n\r\n\\# TODO find example of appealing elements in a song that have been \"well-designed\"\r\n\r\nSimilarly, written works will use elements of the story like plot structure to reflect the theme of narrative being explored. Character development can be heart-wrenching and bittersweet or empowering and dynamic, all drawing the reader in to the story with attractive nuances. Narrative styles like mystery novels that build suspense and exciting clues at just the right time are well-designed stories.\r\n\r\nFor example, the building mystery and details grown throughout the narratives of stories like _Gone Girl_, _The Da Vinci Code_, and _The Silence of the Lambs_. Each story designs the reveal of details and twists-and-turns to keep drawing the reader in.\r\n\r\n### Art\r\n\r\n**The process of imbuing the work with meaning, purpose, and/or value.**\r\n\r\nSo if craft is _how something is made_, and design is _how something is organized_ for aesthetic appeal, what is art? I fully expect this to be the main point of contention for those considering this framework. Or asked another way, **what makes something art?**\r\n\r\nWhen a creative work has symbolism and meaning _breathed_ into the work to enable it to be something more than its _prima facie_ portrayal, it becomes art. An Annunciation painting of Gabriel and Mary might just be an illustration of a biblical scene. However, once the elements are added in their rich symbolism, the painting becomes more art than illustration.\r\n\r\nThe flower being the Word given to Mary, in Gabriel's hand means she has not yet been impregnated, or in her hand, she is with child (and the variations in between). This rich symbolism and meaning speaks to a deeper story being told in the painting.\r\n\r\nBeethoven's 5th Symphony and its legendary motif used in the beginning of the song (and throughout): bum bum bum buuuum. The \"Fate knocking at the door\" motif \"a large-scale narrative of victory and defeat, of the eternal human struggle with fate, of sorrow and redemption\" (Source: [Warning Classics](https://www.warnerclassics.com/release/beethoven-symphony-no-5-fate-knocking-door))\r\n\r\nIn literature, complex themes might provide metaphors for real-world instances of abstract concepts shared in the story. George Orwell's _1984_ uses \"Big Brother\" as a symbol of oppressive, totalitarian, and surveillance. Thought-provoking themes in literature don't just challenge the reader to consider the proposed ideas, but also to put one's self in the position and ask, \"How would I respond?\"\r\n\r\n## Future Exploration\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, this post is only introducing the three-part framework I've outlined here. Future posts will explore more instances of how this framework applies to other creatives works and how versatile it can be.\r\n\r\nThe shortcomings and challenges of the framework will also be considered. Particularly, what instances do not fit so nicely within this framework and why? How does culture affect the framework, or how do varying interpretations apply to what makes a creative work \"art?\"\r\n\r\nLinks will be provided to this post as more content becomes available.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for reading!","src/content/blog/creativity/01-three-part-framework.md","7a1a4edea2325527",{"html":447,"metadata":448},"\u003Cp>In an effort to try and categorize the sometimes nebulous and ever-shifting definition of creative works, I’ve developed a three-part framework for considering creative works.

Much like Aristotle’s various frameworks, e.g. \u003Ca href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-causality/\">the four causes\u003C/a> or \u003Ca href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-rhetoric/\">modes of persuasion\u003C/a>, this framework’s goal is to provide a multifaceted way to look at creative works in a holistic manner.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>This framework’s goal is to provide a multifaceted way to look at creative works in a holistic manner.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Here is the initial framework:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>craft\u003C/strong>: the process of how to make something given certain materials or processes\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>design\u003C/strong>: the process of organizing the components of the work in an aesthetically pleasing manner\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>art\u003C/strong>: the process of imbuing the work with meaning, purpose, and/or value\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"craft\">Craft\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>The process of how to make something given certain materials or processes.\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The combo of “arts and crafts” conjures mental images of Hobby Lobby and Jo-Ann Fabrics. A looser definition of the term “art” will include some paintings for sale, and several books on Bob Ross \u003Cem>plein air\u003C/em> painting instruction books.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, I’m proposing this only scratches (pun intended) at the craft of creative works. It deals with the \u003Cem>how-to\u003C/em> of painting, drawing, sculpting, and modeling.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is not derisive towards craft. It is an essential part of generating creative work. Without the craft, there is nothing to observe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Painters need to know how to mix paint. Musicians need to know how to finger their instrument. Writers need to know how to write legibly and occasionally rhyme words in a poem. Technical implementation details in \u003Cem>how something is made\u003C/em> are quite important.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"design\">Design\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>The process of organizing the components of the work in an aesthetically pleasing manner.\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Given craft works out the technical details of \u003Cem>making\u003C/em> some creative work, design is what makes it appealing and pleasurable to observe. How are the essential parts organized to make the work enjoyable? What does that mean?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In visual creative works, strong design means the visual components, shapes, and elements are composed in an appealing way. Their placement in the layout of the composition is intentional and facilitates what the creator intended. Scale can be used to indicate relative size to other elements or relative size to the observer. Color theory may be used to indicate mood, relationships of elements; red can be used to anger \u003Cem>and\u003C/em> love.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In musical works, melody, harmony, and rhythm can create coherent and aesthetically pleasing songs. The way elements or instruments of the song interact with each other can create pleasing or dissonant combinations, which might reflect and underlying story appealingly. (Note that “aesthetically pleasing” might seem unattractive on its own, but the elements might contrast other elements in appeasing ways.)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp># TODO find example of appealing elements in a song that have been “well-designed”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Similarly, written works will use elements of the story like plot structure to reflect the theme of narrative being explored. Character development can be heart-wrenching and bittersweet or empowering and dynamic, all drawing the reader in to the story with attractive nuances. Narrative styles like mystery novels that build suspense and exciting clues at just the right time are well-designed stories.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For example, the building mystery and details grown throughout the narratives of stories like \u003Cem>Gone Girl\u003C/em>, \u003Cem>The Da Vinci Code\u003C/em>, and \u003Cem>The Silence of the Lambs\u003C/em>. Each story designs the reveal of details and twists-and-turns to keep drawing the reader in.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"art\">Art\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>The process of imbuing the work with meaning, purpose, and/or value.\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So if craft is \u003Cem>how something is made\u003C/em>, and design is \u003Cem>how something is organized\u003C/em> for aesthetic appeal, what is art? I fully expect this to be the main point of contention for those considering this framework. Or asked another way, \u003Cstrong>what makes something art?\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When a creative work has symbolism and meaning \u003Cem>breathed\u003C/em> into the work to enable it to be something more than its \u003Cem>prima facie\u003C/em> portrayal, it becomes art. An Annunciation painting of Gabriel and Mary might just be an illustration of a biblical scene. However, once the elements are added in their rich symbolism, the painting becomes more art than illustration.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The flower being the Word given to Mary, in Gabriel’s hand means she has not yet been impregnated, or in her hand, she is with child (and the variations in between). This rich symbolism and meaning speaks to a deeper story being told in the painting.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Beethoven’s 5th Symphony and its legendary motif used in the beginning of the song (and throughout): bum bum bum buuuum. The “Fate knocking at the door” motif “a large-scale narrative of victory and defeat, of the eternal human struggle with fate, of sorrow and redemption” (Source: \u003Ca href=\"https://www.warnerclassics.com/release/beethoven-symphony-no-5-fate-knocking-door\">Warning Classics\u003C/a>)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In literature, complex themes might provide metaphors for real-world instances of abstract concepts shared in the story. George Orwell’s \u003Cem>1984\u003C/em> uses “Big Brother” as a symbol of oppressive, totalitarian, and surveillance. Thought-provoking themes in literature don’t just challenge the reader to consider the proposed ideas, but also to put one’s self in the position and ask, “How would I respond?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"future-exploration\">Future Exploration\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>As mentioned earlier, this post is only introducing the three-part framework I’ve outlined here. Future posts will explore more instances of how this framework applies to other creatives works and how versatile it can be.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The shortcomings and challenges of the framework will also be considered. Particularly, what instances do not fit so nicely within this framework and why? How does culture affect the framework, or how do varying interpretations apply to what makes a creative work “art?”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Links will be provided to this post as more content becomes available.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thank you so much for reading!\u003C/p>",{"headings":449,"localImagePaths":459,"remoteImagePaths":460,"frontmatter":439,"imagePaths":461},[450,453,454,455,456],{"depth":27,"slug":451,"text":452},"the-framework","The Framework",{"depth":37,"slug":317,"text":318},{"depth":37,"slug":320,"text":321},{"depth":37,"slug":323,"text":324},{"depth":27,"slug":457,"text":458},"future-exploration","Future Exploration",[],[],[],"creativity/01-three-part-framework.md","vue-slots-di",{"id":463,"data":465,"body":468,"filePath":469,"digest":470,"rendered":471,"legacyId":478},{"external":12,"draft":262,"title":466,"description":264,"date":467},"Vue Slots & Dependency Injection",["Date","2022-11-05T00:00:00.000Z"],"Vue slots can be used to flatten (from the written markup perspective) application architecture so injecting dependencies is easier from a composition root (e.g. `App.vue`).\r\n\r\n(Use PayFac as an example)\r\n\r\n- Explain how slots can flatten composition and DI (think warp drive and compressing space)\r\n- This supports the SRP idea: slotted components focus on one thing (e.g. layout).\r\n- This makes DI clearer from composition roots (App.vue, SomeComplexPage.vue)\r\n- This enables prop usage where otherwise would require prop-drilling, provide/inject, or singleton management (e.g. stores)","src/content/blog/vue-slots-di.md","e14460d187f652dd",{"html":472,"metadata":473},"\u003Cp>Vue slots can be used to flatten (from the written markup perspective) application architecture so injecting dependencies is easier from a composition root (e.g. \u003Ccode>App.vue\u003C/code>).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>(Use PayFac as an example)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Explain how slots can flatten composition and DI (think warp drive and compressing space)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>This supports the SRP idea: slotted components focus on one thing (e.g. layout).\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>This makes DI clearer from composition roots (App.vue, SomeComplexPage.vue)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>This enables prop usage where otherwise would require prop-drilling, provide/inject, or singleton management (e.g. stores)\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>",{"headings":474,"localImagePaths":475,"remoteImagePaths":476,"frontmatter":465,"imagePaths":477},[],[],[],[],"vue-slots-di.md","msw-reminder",{"id":479,"data":481,"body":490,"filePath":491,"digest":492,"rendered":493,"legacyId":509},{"external":12,"draft":262,"title":482,"description":483,"date":484,"tags":485},"Mock Service Worker Reminder","I'm reminded of a solution to an occasionally-occurring problem using MSW.js during localhost development.",["Date","2024-06-10T00:00:00.000Z"],[486,487,488,489],"msw","web-dev","frontend","service-workers","# Mock Service Worker Reminder\r\n\r\nI've been using Mock Service Worker (MSW) for a couple of years now, and it's really been a game-changer. I love not worrying about mocking implementations of services and mocking the API response instead. It's brilliant.\r\n\r\n## The Issue\r\n\r\nI frequently find myself having a similar problem though, which is entirely on my end. I keep getting requests returning my markup instead of the desired JSON data. That obviously causes bad requests or handling of data. For example…\r\n\r\n\u003Cfigure>\r\n    \u003Cimg src=\"/images/blog/msw-reminder--example-JSON-parse.jpg\" alt=\"Example JSON Parse Result\">\r\n    \u003Cimg src=\"./images/msw-reminder--example-JSON-parse.jpg\" alt=\"Example JSON Parse Result\">\r\n    \u003Cfigcaption>Example JSON Parse Result\u003Cfigcaption>\r\n\u003C/figure>\r\n\r\n## The Solution\r\n\r\nThe source of my problem relatively simple: **I'm making requests too soon.**\r\n\r\nMy current setup is to call `worker.start()` inside of a helper function that only optionally loads the MSW resources. This helps keep my production bundle size smaller. There is also a way to wait for the service worker to finish loading so that my particular problem doesn't happen.\r\n\r\n[Kent C. Dodds had this issue addressed in Issue 73](https://github.com/mswjs/msw/issues/73), which reminded me of how to wait for the workers to be ready. Specifically, [@kettanaito](https://github.com/kettanaito)'s [answer](https://github.com/mswjs/msw/issues/73#issuecomment-601584127) shows that the `start()` method is async and needs to be `await`ed in order for requests to follow correctly. Of course!\r\n\r\nI then found my most recent troublemaker in this instance of the problem. I was overly ambitious in making one of my modules (which makes the problem request) fetching data too early. It looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { computed } from 'vue';\r\nimport { getConfig } from './getConfig';\r\n\r\n// 👇 the line that's calling too early\r\nconst config = getConfig(); // Promise\u003CConfig> where Config is a reactive Vue object\r\n\r\nconst origin = computed(() => config?.someOrigin ?? '');\r\nconst link = computed(() => `${origin.value}/${endpoint}`);\r\n\r\nexport function useLink() {\r\n    // … some caching logic for the config to only need to fetch it once…\r\n\r\n    return link;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe solution ended up being simple this time. I just needed to move the initial fetch of the config to the `useLink()` composable so that it would be called after MSW's load finishes.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { computed } from 'vue';\r\nimport { getConfig } from './getConfig';\r\n\r\n// 👇 the line that's calling too early\r\nconst { config, execute } = getConfig(); // refactored as a composable to return the reactive config, which will be updated once execute() finishes\r\n\r\nconst origin = computed(() => config?.someOrigin ?? '');\r\nconst link = computed(() => `${origin.value}/${endpoint}`);\r\n\r\nexport function useLink() {\r\n    // … some caching logic for the config to only need to fetch it once…\r\n    \r\n    execute(); // just letting this resolve behind the scenes; the \r\n    return link;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, I chopped up my original code somewhat to preserve private code, but this is the essence of the situation. Using a combo of reactivity and making calls at the right time, I could refactor to allow MSW to finish loading, which then allows the mocked config request to be handled by MSW.\r\n\r\n**The takeaway**: don't make requests before they're ready to be handled in MSW.\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgement\r\n\r\nI know this is a dev-setup issue and isn't likely to be relevant in production or even dev-server testing (i.e. non-localhost). The API from which I fetch the config will already be up and running, so this is a moot issue regarding that.\r\n\r\nHowever, I use MSW a **lot**, and it's great to remember with clarity why I've run into this issue in the past. Hopefully by writing this post, I'll remind myself and/or cement the knowledge in memory better.\r\n\r\nHope this helps, dear anonymous reader!","src/content/blog/msw-reminder.md","7c2232ce370127f8",{"html":494,"metadata":495},"\u003Ch1 id=\"mock-service-worker-reminder\">Mock Service Worker Reminder\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>I’ve been using Mock Service Worker (MSW) for a couple of years now, and it’s really been a game-changer.

This works in most cases, which is excellent. It's short and easy to read. Win.\r\n\r\n## Async Behavior\r\n\r\nHowever, not all async behaviors are so easily handled. In many of my components, especially view components with dynamic data tables fetching data from APIs, I must wait for data to return from the server in order to assert my expectations.\r\n\r\nThis might be as simple as fetching the data and ensuring I have the column count expected, displayed data is formatted correctly (e.g. phone numbers, money amounts, etc.), or that individual row actions are displaying as they should. It may be as complicated as interacting with the table and ensuring toast messages, error alerts, or other user feedback is displayed. That often requires multiple requests.\r\n\r\n## My Solution\r\n\r\nMy solution has been to handle the changes I want to test for, then emit custom events from the component that are used (sometimes exclusively) by the testing code. Pretend we have a page like `RecordLookup` that performs basic CRUD operations on records.\r\n\r\nLet's say the events will be `load`, `record-create`, `record-update`, `update-error`, & `record-delete`. \r\n\r\n**Note:** I'm not using past-tense in order to mimic native DOM events like `click` instead of `clicked`.\r\n\r\nUsing MSW, I am able to make async requests that take longer than the 10-ish ms  that `nextTick()` typically takes. This means we cannot rely on only the `await` keyword. In addition to that, we don't have a reference to the promise that will be awaited when the data returns. \r\n\r\nThis means **setting callbacks on custom events**. This can be done through VTU's prop bindings.\r\n\r\nThis also means **I cannot rely on the regular callback signature** for Vitest's `test` function (I prefer the `it` alias). This is where the [Done Callback](https://vitest.dev/guide/migration.html#done-callback) comes into play.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I must be sure to handle exceptions in the test code, which is usually how the failed tests are communicated.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ndescribe('Record Lookup', () => {\r\n    it('should load records automatically', () => new Promise((done, fail) => {\r\n        const wrapper = mount(RecordLookup, {\r\n            props: {\r\n                // I prefer to keep the wrapper portion as small as possible\r\n                // for easier reading/skimming. When it gets too big, I have\r\n                // trouble keeping track of block endings.\r\n                // Moving the expectation code to another function also lets\r\n                // me handle the promise more simply.\r\n                onLoaded: checkForData().then(done).catch(fail),\r\n            },\r\n        });\r\n        async function checkForData() {\r\n            // some assertion code to check that rows exist, no error/empty msg \r\n            // is displaying, etc.\r\n        }\r\n    }));\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe other events discussed can be handled similarly, and each custom event listener must handle errors. Only the final callback needs the `done` (or `resolve` if you follow ESLint) callback called.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nit('should delete a record', () => new Promise((done, fail) => {\r\n    const wrapper = mount(RecordLookup, {\r\n        props: {\r\n            // Remember: the data is auto-fetched when mounted & \"loaded\" emits.\r\n            onLoaded: deleteRecord().catch(fail),\r\n            // Notice the quoted key; the custom event is converted into\r\n            // \"on{Snake-case-name}\" with multiple word event names.\r\n            'onRecord-delete': confirmDeletion.then(done).catch(fail),\r\n        },\r\n    });\r\n    async function deleteRecord() {\r\n        // …\r\n    }\r\n    async function confirmDeletion() {\r\n        // expect deleted record is no longer in the table\r\n    }\r\n}));\r\n```\r\n\r\nHandling custom events this way allows me to test async behaviors extensively from Vitest alone (for better or worse). Using custom events and handlers can help keep components from being tested by their implementation and instead rely on input/output pairings that remain decoupled from implementation details.\r\n\r\nHit me up on the socials if you have feedback, criticisms, or improvements that can be made to this process. I've not covered all the nuances that I have on a given test case, but this illustrates the idea well enough. Also let me know if you're interested in more scenarios/examples you'd like to see.\r\n\r\nHappy testing, devs!","src/content/blog/testing-components-async.md","5845d54fe5638d09",{"html":523,"metadata":524},"\u003Ch1 id=\"testing-components-with-async-behaviors\">Testing Components with Async Behaviors\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>In my normal dev setup, I’m using \u003Ca href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">Vue.js\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"https://vite.dev/\">Vite\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"https://vitest.dev/\">Vitest\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"https://mswjs.io/\">MSW.js\u003C/a> (I wrote about \u003Ca href=\"/blog/msw-lessons/\">some MSW lessons\u003C/a> recently too), and \u003Ca href=\"https://test-utils.vuejs.org/\">@vue/test-utils\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Vue Test Utils (VTU) is particularly helpful when dealing with interacting with components and the DOM, e.g. clicking buttons or triggering key events.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"ts\">\u003Ccode>\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#F97583\">await\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> wrapper.\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#B392F0\">find\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">'button'\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">).\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#B392F0\">trigger\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">'click'\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">);\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>Internally, \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/test-utils/blob/6332d7c434fd9d4e10a61a821ae27c7778bc397f/src/baseWrapper.ts#L366\">VTU uses Vue’s \u003Ccode>nextTick()\u003C/code>\u003C/a> to dispatch the event and wait for the \u003Ca href=\"https://vuejs.org/api/general#nexttick\">next tick\u003C/a>.

I thought, \"Oh great, one more dependency to manage and learn.\" After reading through the article and skimming the docs site, I was curious enough to try it. I had a series of green field projects ramping up where I could refine my use of it. I didn't know how much I'd fall in love with it.\r\n\r\n## Why Mock APIs?\r\n\r\nThe projects where I used MSW were front-end SPAs with a C# API back-end. While I know enough C# to make changes or build front-of-the-back-end libraries, I don't build full APIs in C# regularly enough to do it fast. This was a time where being fast was very valuable. (I'm also not a keen fan of .NET's way of handling things. It's not terrible. It's just not my preferred flavor.)\r\n\r\nSo I got to mocking the API instead and found a number of benefits.\r\n\r\n### Early API Design\r\n\r\nMy current pattern is to review the Figma designs and step through the flow of the screens. I comment in the designs or take notes in my markdown notes as I go. **The key is to identify where I expect requests will need to be made.**\r\n\r\nAs I make note of which requests I expect are needed, I also make an initial design of the request body \"shape.\" This allows me to (1) collaborate with the back-end developer(s) and (2) build an initial API mock so I can get started right away. No need to wait on the actual API.\r\n\r\n### Rapid Early Iteration\r\n\r\nGiven the API endpoint and payloads are at least initially designed, I can now start writing the actual service functions that will make the request for data. Once I switch to using the actual API, if the design doesn't change, these functions need not change.\r\n\r\nThis is also where one of my other favorite tools comes into play: [faker.js](https://fakerjs.dev/api/). I need to return some kind of data, often complex, when I make these mock requests. I also need more than a couple of rows. We often have paginated data tables, so I need 20-50 records of relatively unique data.\r\n\r\nI write a script to generate the dummy data based on the expected response data, then in the MSW endpoint handler script, I import that JSON, cache it (so data is updated between requests), and return it to the UI.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport fs from 'fs';\r\nimport path from 'path';\r\nimport { faker } from '@faker-js/faker';\r\n\r\n// example generator script\r\nfunction generateTransaction() {\r\n    // mock the data as needed using faker\r\n    // …\r\n    return {…};\r\n}\r\n\r\n// … other implementation code; when simple enough, I can have AI do a lot of\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @param {Array} dataToWrite Array of data to write to file\r\n */\r\nfunction writeToFile(dataToWrite) {\r\n    const fileName = path.resolve('src/mocks/TransactionDetails.all.json');\r\n    fs.writeFile(fileName, JSON.stringify(dataToWrite, null, 2), (err) => {\r\n        if (err)\r\n            throw err;\r\n        console.log('File written successfully!');\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n\r\nwriteToFile(callNTimes(generateTransaction, 55));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Unit Test Compatibility\r\n\r\nThese mocked endpoints also make unit testing fairly straight forward. I can still simulate the behavior to test it. I often emit events from components once data has loaded, is being fetched, and when POST/PUT/PATCH requests succeed or fail. That way, in the test, I can listen for those events and make assertions.\r\n\r\n### Web Socket Testing\r\n\r\nVery recently, [MSW began supporting Web Sockets](https://mswjs.io/docs/basics/handling-websocket-events/). This was excellent timing, as one of our products began using web sockets to live update its data tables based on when records were coming in, going out, or being updated.\r\n\r\nSome extra testing setup was necessary to manually trigger web socket events, but it all works great. (I grab the socket connection, send my own event to the \"server,\" and that triggers an update event to be handled by the UI.)\r\n\r\n## Challenges\r\n\r\n### Maintenance\r\n\r\n**Maintaining the mocked API is the greatest challenge, just as it would be with mocking services.** Once changes happen in the real API, disciplined devs must remember to update the mocks and tests. When these stagnate and become out of sync, it causes issues in automated tests and localhost development.\r\n\r\nIt's fairly common that the API contract will update during development, so I must keep my mocks up-to-date as well. This is to be expected now.\r\n\r\n### Conditional Loading\r\n\r\nUpon monitoring the bundled assets, I discovered that MSW was being included in my production bundles. This was unacceptable.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this, I wrote a helper function that can be called from the `main.ts` script (e.g. `maybeLoadMocks()`). Within that helper, I check environment variables for whether or not the APIs should be mocked (e.g. assuming Vite, `VITE_MOCK_API=true`). If true, I use a dynamic import to fetch the MSW init code.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// maybeLoadMocks.ts\r\n\r\n// imported from constants so vitest can stub them\r\nimport { isDev, shouldMockAPI } from '@/constants';\r\n\r\nexport const shouldLoadMocks = isDev && shouldMockAPI;\r\n\r\nexport async function maybeLoadMocks() {\r\n    if (!shouldLoadMocks)\r\n        return;\r\n\r\n    const { useMocks } = await import('../mocks/useMocks');\r\n    useMocks();\r\n}\r\n\r\n// useMocks.ts\r\nimport { worker } from '@/mocks/browser';\r\n\r\nexport function useMocks() {\r\n    worker.start({\r\n        onUnhandledRequest(request, print) {\r\n            const url = new URL(request.url);\r\n            // By convention, our APIs start with \"/api/v{number}\"\r\n            if (/^\\/api\\/v\\d+/.test(url.pathname) === false)\r\n                return;\r\n\r\n            print.warning();\r\n        },\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Main Takeaways\r\n\r\n- Early API planning reveals blind spots and faulty assumptions when there's time to fix them.\r\n- Early API planning also forces a closer look at mockups/designs to solve problems early.\r\n- Early working API designs enables rapid iteration and development, including early unit testing.\r\n- Maintenance requires intentionality.\r\n- Bundles should be checked regularly.\r\n\r\nThese have been really great lessons, and my experience with MSW has been awesome. I highly recommend trying [MSW (Mock Service Worker)](https://mswjs.io/) in your next project, especially if you're on a team and are not responsible for writing the API. \r\n\r\nIt may even be helpful for full stack devs depending on which side you start building first. I've noticed building more complex request handlers has allowed me to make changes or catch things the API would encounter in low-impact settings. No expensive cloud functions or database involvement required.\r\n\r\nHappy building, friends 🙂","src/content/blog/msw-lessons.md","c63ce4c6defde53c",{"html":551,"metadata":552},"\u003Ch1 id=\"msw-lessons\">MSW Lessons\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>A little over a year ago, I read an article (\u003Ca href=\"https://kentcdodds.com/blog/stop-mocking-fetch\">I think by Kent Dodds\u003C/a>) about \u003Ca href=\"https://mswjs.io/\">MSW (Mock Service Worker)\u003C/a> that recommended mocking API calls instead of mocking service functions/classes to grab data.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I initially found this suggestion dubious.

I've always wanted to understand how these cool features work. I've never really known the term(s) for them until recently. Here's how I started using it on this site.\r\n\r\n## Learning the Term\r\n\r\nI began by searching Google for things like \"floating nodes js,\" \"floating dots js,\" and similar searches, but anything with \"nodes\" gave me Node.js results (no surprise) and others were not helpful either. I then tried Grok and described the behavior the best I could. This produced helpful results. The following was my prompt…\r\n\r\n> Context: HTML canvas element & JS\r\n> \r\n> What's it called when a canvas element has animated nodes (pin points like stars) floating around that draw lines to each other when they're close enough?\r\n\r\n… and part of Grok's reply witht he helpful bits…\r\n\r\n> What you're describing is commonly referred to as a \"particle network\" or \"connected particles animation\" in the context of an HTML canvas element and JavaScript.…\r\n\r\nNow I had my terms. With a few confirmation searches using \"particle network\" to ensure it wasn't hallucinating, I began researching some GitHub & blogged options.\r\n\r\n## Experimenting\r\n\r\nI searched through the options available, and there are some tutorials for creating this myself, which I will certainly be doing in the future for my own learning/leveling-up. For now, I just want a quick addition to get started and will refine from there. I landed on the [decade-old `canvas-particle-network`](https://github.com/JulianLaval/canvas-particle-network). It's easy to get running quickly, which is what I was after. It won't give me everything I want, so I can either fork the repo or start from scratch elsewhere, but again, this is just to get up and running.\r\n\r\nI dropped a copy of the script in my `/public` folder (the npm package didn't have TypeScript definitions working quite right when I tried installing from there, so I left the copy+paste version in place). One trick to playing with canvas is never knowing when it's rendering the canvas or not, so I (1) set the `body` background to red (`#a00`) and the canvas background passed to the library to a darker red (`#300`). This told me which was rendering.\r\n\r\nOnce it started rendering the particle network nodes and edges, I unset the reds and played with the colors & nodes of the particles.\r\n\r\n## Giving It A Home\r\n\r\nNow that I had the settings I liked, I took the time to make a separate component for the particle network to handle logic like init, a11y settings (see below), and when to load the script.\r\n\r\n### Accessibility (a11y)\r\n\r\nSeeing it all, I noticed it's *a lot* of movement. I know about (but don't often use) the `prefers-reduced-motion` feature. This was a great chance to play more with it.\r\n\r\n`window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)')` returns an object and `.matches` provides a boolean for the setting.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst reducedMotionMediaQuery = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)');\r\nif (!reducedMotionMediaQuery.matches) {\r\n    startAnimation();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCouple this with the handy `change` event listener, and I can toggle the start/stop of the animation.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst reducedMotionMediaQuery = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)');\r\nif (!reducedMotionMediaQuery.matches) {\r\n    startAnimation();\r\n}\r\nreducedMotionMediaQuery.addEventListener('change', (event) => {\r\n    if (event.matches) {\r\n        stopAnimation();\r\n    } else {\r\n        startAnimation();\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn future iterations (i.e. when I build my own), I'd like to set a fade transition for when it starts/stops the animation. Perhaps a callback for when the transition completes as well. Also, a method to start and stop the animation would be a great improvement.\r\n\r\nI also added a mostly opaque background color to the content space to avoid floating particles/edges from distracting from reading. I used *some* transparency though, because frankly, I'm a sucker for see-through effects. An additional `box-shadow` with a generous spread helps it fade a bit. This content background only shows when the effect is active though.\r\n\r\n## Wrap Up\r\n\r\nSo that wraps my report for the new particle network feature running in the background! As mentioned already, there are a few features I'll be adding to improve the site/feature:\r\n\r\n- reduced motion toggle\r\n- custom implementation (start/stop methods + transition callback)\r\n- theme-sensitivity (after I add a theme toggle…)","src/content/blog/particle-network-addition.md","3c3aaa894841087a",{"html":599,"metadata":600},"\u003C!-- https://web.archive.org/web/20150727021631/https://blog.alexwendland.com/2015/particle-network-js-animations/ -->\n\u003Ch1 id=\"particle-network-addition\">Particle Network Addition\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>I’ve recently added a “particle network” animation to my background.

The following is a brief update on the work I've been doing on my website to update the Particle Network background effect that's probably floating around (pun intended). Read part 1 if you're interested.\r\n\r\nThe updates I've made:\r\n\r\n- theme toggle control (separate but related)\r\n- theme sensitivity\r\n- custom implementation\r\n\r\nLet's dig in!\r\n\r\n## Theme Toggle Control\r\n\r\nI added a theme toggle control (in the bottom right if I haven't moved it yet). Okay, okay, technically it's \"dark mode/light mode\" toggling; whatever. The animation effect on toggling is one of those fun little flairs I just love adding. The first implementation was fine, but I discovered during the Particle Network update that I had mixed unrelated code…\r\n\r\n![Shame Gif](https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExeWs4Zmxka2xkZDNiMmoyOXE4OWpvdWVybjBremNuOG8yYjNnZTMwMiZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/pDsCoECKh1Pa/giphy.gif)\r\n\r\nSo I moved that code to the toggle component where it belongs.\r\n\r\nOne funny whoops I ran into was forgetting which CSS library I've been using. I built this site using [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/) to provide me with… well, very simple CSS styling. Bootstrap is a classic, and I could have gone that route, but I was looking for something simpler and lighter.\r\n\r\nTailwind is great in a lot of ways and *really* verbose in the markup. I wanted to keep it lighter still. I haven't done a complex analytical comparison between both implementations, so I don't know if it's actually simpler and lighter or not.\r\n\r\nWhat I *thought* I was using was [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/), another minimal style library that appeals to my interest in just using semantic HTML and making it look good. I like Pico's theme handling approach (for the most part). I fought with my site for a while before I realized I am still using Simple rather than Pico. That explains why the theming features weren't working as expect. 😅\r\n\r\n> It's the little things filling your day that will stoke or suffocate your passions.\r\n\r\nOne additional change regarding the theme toggle styles I made was to move the updated CSS variables from the `html` tag's inline styles into a dynamically-generated `style` tag. I check for the tag's existence, create and append it if missing, then set the `innerHTML` of the tag. this cleans up the devtool's rendered Elements tag perhaps an arbitrary amount, but enough that *I* like it. I also [re-]learned a fun concise way to create the element if it's not present.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst styleId = 'someStyles';\r\nconst style = document.head.querySelector(`#${styleId}`)\r\n    ?? Object.assign(document.createElement('style'), { id: styleId });\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's a silly thing, but doesn't that `Object.assign` remind you a little of jQuery's classically awesome element creation overload? Y'know, the one that looks like this: \r\n\r\n```js\r\n$('\u003Cstyle>', { id: styleId })\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat a gem. Fond memories. It's the little things filling your day that will stoke or suffocate your passions.\r\n\r\n## Theme Sensitivity\r\n\r\nNow that I have theme toggle controls, I wanted to make the Particle Network more sensitive. I was brute forcing the theme toggle controls initially (i.e. stopping/starting the lib). I built into the library (upon rewriting it - see below) the ability to update the options and have those changes update the canvas immediately. Not much to it!\r\n\r\nOne additional benefit to this update was to locate the \"source of truth\" regarding styles in CSS where I want it and not repeat data that easily falls out-of-sync otherwise. Specifically, the background and particle colors are being set when the theme updates, and I'm grabbing those computed colors when the Particle Network (Astro component) notices the change. It looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst computedStyle = getComputedStyle(document.documentElement);\r\nconst particleNetworkOptions = {\r\n    particleColor: computedStyle.getPropertyValue('--particle'),\r\n    background: computedStyle.getPropertyValue('--bg'),\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, when it gets set and the options need updated, this code can run and just grab the correct values.\r\n\r\n## Custom Implementation\r\n\r\nThis goal had two facets: (1) to learn the thought process of the Particle Network better and (2) to gain greater control over a cool-but-outdated library. That control is what enabled me to build in the option update and others.\r\n\r\nI admit I started the rewrite with some AI help. That rewrote the older code into a TypeScript class for me. Then I picked my way through and cleaned up the unnecessary and hallucinated code. This helped me get familiar with, customize, and study the library more.\r\n\r\nThis just seems like one of those features I'll be iterating on over the months and maybe years, so I expect more articles like this discussing updates and lessons learned.\r\n\r\n## Wrap Up\r\n\r\nSome things I've valued most about this update:\r\n\r\n- deeper learning & customization of the Particle Network code\r\n- integration (and with looser coupling) of independent site components\r\n- clearly defined \"source of truth\" for styles and a relatively inexpensive way to access them (there *is* some perf cost but not enough to worry)\r\n\r\nUntil next time!
