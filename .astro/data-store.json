The UX/UI design team worked to build the initial components in Figma, and I worked closely with them to implement the components using the Vue.js library.\n\nWe discussed whether to use Bootstrap or Tailwind (which was gaining popularity at the time). Given (1) Tailwind's youth and (2) our existing ubiquitous usage of Bootstrap, we ended up staying with Bootstrap. They are the only two runtime dependencies that GravITI has.\n\n## Purpose\n\n\"Why not use an existing UI library like Vuetify, Quasar, or PrimeVue?\" Well, we *did* use PrimeVue for some early projects. It had the benefit of theming and existing functionality. It was a close call to either use PrimeVue or roll our own library. As for the other options, Quasar and Vuetify required too much buy-in for our purposes, and we have many legacy application in transition where we wanted to use the library at various states of transition without needing to update *everything*.\n\n**The reason to choose an in-house solution ultimately came down to an interest in control.** We wanted full control over the functionality, design, and roadmap of the library. I'm uncertain if I would have pushed for PrimeVue had I then the knowledge I have now. 🤔 One clear benefit has been the learning process along the way, i.e., how to configure tooling to generate a bundle usable in bundled projects and at runtime. In retrospect, the experience with Storybook has been valuable as well.\n\n## Design Details\n\nThe designs were done in Figma, so I spent a lot of time looking through the elements and their associated styles. That meant grabbing values from Figma, but it also meant communicating with the designers when some details were complicated. For example, Bootstrap uses units divisible by 16 to play with the browser's default setting of `16px === 1rem`. The designers were in the habit of base-5 units though. After some conversations and decision making, we ended up following the base-16 units. \n\nUnsurprisingly, there were many other issues to work through as the project evolved, but that's a story for another day.\n\n## Technical Details\n\nThe following is the current (as of Nov. 20, 2024) tech stack used within the GravITI library:\n\n- Vue.js (love that data reactivity)\n- Bootstrap\n- Vite (it began using Vue-CLI, but the transition was made as Vite matured into its v1 releases)\n- Jest (it's on the roadmap to switch to Vitest)\n- Storybook (more on this below)\n\n### Storybook\n\nWhen I began, Storybook became a very helpful tool for getting my components into a robust testing UI space and offered a lot in the way of out-of-the-box documentation. This was a great boon for my progress in advancing the library, which was (and still is) often a political game with the business units of the company. Those close to the technical portions of projects understand the value to keeping the library up-to-date. Those further away understandably… don't care.\n\nIn one of the minor version updates though, I noticed *a lot* of dependencies come down for Storybook. They were React-heavy packages (understandably given the underlying architecture is React). Many TypeScript type definitions came down as well. Here's where my problems began.\n\nSome of the `@types` definitions for Storybook may have been helpful for Storybook itself, and even React for relevant projects, but my Vue project types kept getting stomped on. Perhaps I could have contributed to the community work and figured out the solution for others in a similar situation, but the reality is (1) I have trouble selling explicit community support work or (2) working it into the other dev work to justify its inclusion in my task work.\n\nMaybe that's a \"blah blah blah, excuses\" thing, but it's what's real in my current experience. All in all, while Storybook has been a great help, this and some other issues have been complicating factors.\n\n## Wrap up\n\nUltimately, the project continues to be one of the more challenging and rewarding projects I've worked on at ITI. The foundational level they play in our applications means diligence and care must be taken. There's a large bull whip effect that happens when changes are made at that low a level of UI development.

The purpose of this site is to provide an online portal for taking the written portion of the state driver's examination. Users register their information, often paying online, and take the exam all online. Test results, emails, and a strictly controlled user flow through the website are all part of the experience.\n\n**One of the more interesting aspects is the facial recognition feature during the exam.** A user allows access to his/her webcam, takes a control photo of a neutral expression of their face, and that photo is used as the control for facial matches throughout the exam. Photos are taken randomly throughout the exam and compared against the control photo. Any anomalies will cause the user to incur infractions that are tracked for auditing purposes when deemed necessary. This is one of my favorite features of the site.\n\nOne of the challenging aspects of the site is its architecture. It is a classic MVC website, so the front-end optimizations/updates I've made have been working within that paradigm instead of using a single-page application. This isn't generally a problem as many pages are simple text/disclaimer pages or require little to no JS. (Why load Vue.js or other libraries when vanilla JS will do?)\n\nOther more feature-rich pages do require a special touch. In addition to more interactive needs for some pages, each state has customizations and settings that can be adjusted on the site. The list of features offered has grown in four years, and many bitter lessons have been learned along the way. This is inevitable for any project with similar demands, and ensuring backwards compatibility and proper abstractions are part of the challenge. When it's done right though, it's very rewarding.\n\n## Web Applications\n\nAlong with the driver testing projects are a number of support admin applications. Some states request tools for managing Translators that can be provided on the fly for test-takers with English as a second language. Others may require customized driving routes (see the *SkillsTo Drive* project description below). There are many nuanced needs that arise when dealing with so many different states and jurisdictions. (ITI services many US states as well as several Canadian territories.) **We have built a lot of helper applications for our clients.**\n\nEach of these applications follows the single-page application architecture (in contrast to *KnowTo Drive Online*'s multi-page application structure, i.e. a classic website). Minimally, a Vue UI (using Vite as its bundler and our GravITI UI library) runs the front-end while one or more APIs provide data on the back-end. It's pretty standard stuff. Customizations are less common in these applications but not absent.\n\n## Others\n\nOther applications I've worked on stretch into less conventional web application spaces. As part of a collaborative effort with a third-party agency who were helping us in a very busy time, our team built a new app called *SkillsTo Drive*. This app is used on the road during the driver's test where the instructor uses a tablet to inspect the vehicle and keep track of driving test points for a particular route.\n\nThe *SkillsTo Drive* app is built in [*React Native for Windows*](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows). My opinion of *React Native for Windows* has been mixed. React Native as a core concept is a great way to help web developers break into the native/mobile app spaces. While the performance will never be quite as good as a native app in their typical languages, it lets developers build apps quickly in a space they'd otherwise take longer to build. *React Native for Windows* in particular has not seen the frequency of stable updates we had hoped when we joined the third-party team in its development.\n\nAll the same, it's a great product to offer state driver testing offices. (Personally, I'd be very interested in building a Progressive Web App version some day, but it's unlikely that proposal will gain traction while the current app is still relatively young.)\n\n## Coda\n\nThis is just a brief dip into the kinds of projects I've been working on with the great ITI team. There are still so many great opportunities and ideas, some of which are on the horizon. The greatest challenge has been finding the right timing for many of the projects and improvements we see daily (consequences of working so closely with them).\n\nAs ever, the tech world offers no shortage of fascinating new topics to study.","src/content/work/iti-projects.md","7b42d6c64981f924",{"html":57,"metadata":58},"\u003Ch1 id=\"iti-projects\">ITI Projects\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>I’ve written a bit more in-depth about my work on \u003Ca href=\"/work/iti-graviti\">ITI’s GravITI UI Library\u003C/a>, but this is about my broader body of work at ITI.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"website\">Website\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The first project I began working on is the \u003Cem>KnowTo Drive Online\u003C/em> website.

Nothing I'll cover here is new or revelatory, but you're still reading, so let's get to it.\n\nWhatever else it might be, **the story of the Fall is a metaphor that applies as much to us today as in the human genesis.** To be clear, I'm not calling into question or even addressing if I think the story is grounded in history. (I do, but that's not what I'm focusing on here.) I'm proposing that the Fall is an archetype of human behavior that still plays out today.\n\n## The Details\n\nLet's summarize the story briefly, though it's short enough to read in its entirety in Genesis 2 & 3. \n\n- God creates Adam (literally the \"human/man,\" like how we say \"mankind\" or \"humanity\").\n- God instructs \"the man\" (i.e. Adam) to eat from *anything* in the Garden *except* for \"the tree of knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die\" (Gen. 2:17 NIV).\n- Later, God creates \"the woman\" (Gen. 2:21-22), who is not named \"Eve\" until after the Fall (Gen. 3:20), interestingly.\n- The serpent (who is only associated with Satan in the New Testament; perhaps a later developed idea) convinces Even to eat the fruit (while Adam sat idly by; another often-overlooked detail; Gen. 3:6), who also gives some to her husband in the same sitting.\n- Their eyes \"were opened\" and they noticed their vulnerability (nakedness) and tried to cover it (another metaphor for hiding their shame; sidebar: try to understand nakedness in the cultural context rather than our own to appreciate what's being communicated.)\n\n## The Interpretation\n\nThe man/human/Adam is created, given instructions (another way to say it, given \"the Law\" or *torah*) on how to live in the Garden, given work, then given a helper (not a servant, but genuinely a helpmate; someone to strengthen Adam and help enable him in his God-given work). *Then*, God's instructions are challenged, misinterpreted/misquoted (by Eve and not corrected by Adam), and ignored.\n\nHere's the crux of the issue: **eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil is akin to rejecting God's instructions and going one's own way.**\n\nThe expression \"good and evil\" is an idiot to express two extremes of the moral spectrum, good and evil, and everything in between. This is common in Hebrew literature: \"the heavens and the earth\" from the perspective of pre-scientific astronomy means \"the very top to the very bottom;\" \"as far as the east to the west\" means the furthest extremes on this physical plain; and of course, \"good and evil\" means \"all moral actions.\" Another way to more concisely express the idea in modern English would be \"the tree of moral knowledge.\"\n\n> Eating from the tree of moral knowledge is akin to rejecting God's instructions and going one's own way.\n\nGod instructs humanity (Adam and by extension Eve) to partake in all the activities available, but don't determine for yourselves what is morally right and wrong; that's God's job. (In apologetic discussions of the problem of evil/pain/suffering, moral law is not something God declares, nor something co-existing with God that God follows as the Euthyphro dilemma would suggest; moral law extends from God's own character).\n\nTo restate and rephrase: **eating from the tree of moral knowledge is akin to rejecting God's instructions and going one's own way.**\n\nWhen (any) human eats from that tree, the person declares, \"I know better than God's instruction on this matter,\" and effectively asserts moral superiority *over* God. It's fundamentally an act of pride and self-glorification/deification. Now the weight of the sin/fault is clear.\n\n## The Solution\n\nIt took a long time for the solution to become clear. When Jesus lived and worked on earth, he followed God's instructions. His life became a model for all \"Adams\" (and Eves). Much more can be said about the nature of cultural and ritual sacrifices, the atonement of sins, and the role Jesus played there, but again, that's another topic for another day.\n\n\"Jesus is the answer\" as the saying goes. Specifically, trusting that Jesus can and will save you from your own \"fruit-eating\" and help reunite you to the affectionate Creator Who strolled with us through the Garden.

Similar to how [Aristotle's four causes](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-causality/#FourCaus) attempt to provide a mental model for a deeper understanding of some thing, this model for thinking about creative ventures strives to better understand creativity by describing it more clearly.\n\nMore posts will follow in explaining and challenging the ideas I'll propose here. For now, an explanation of my mental model.\n\n## A Tripartite Model of Creativity\n\nThree terms are commonly use to describe various creative works: art, craft, and design. I've never liked the ambiguity between \"arts and crafts\" or \"art and design.\" In my undergrad, where I focused on digital arts as fine art, I worked near and with designers a lot, as well as artists. When one of my artist peers claimed abstract are was more design than art to him, it got me thinking.\n\nWhat do I think \"art\" is? What is \"design?\" What is a craft, or what does it mean to craft something?\n\n### Craft\n\nBeginning with \"craft,\" in this model, **the craft of a creative work is the technical \"how-to\" in making the work**. In drawing, this means choosing the right material, e.g. graphite, charcoal, conte crayon, colored pencils, etc. That can also include shading techniques like blending, hatching, cross-hatching, pointillism, etc.\n\n> These are hands-on skills that anyone can learn technically.\n\nThis is not limited to 2d work like painting and drawing. It can describe 3d art like pottery or sculpting. How is clay shaped or scored to be combined? How is a mold made to cast into other materials? These are hands-on skills that anyone can learn technically.\n\nStretch the idea further. How do couples dance the Tango or salsa? How does an entrepreneur set up and start a new company? How do writers put words to paper (digital or analog)?\n\nA creative work's craft is all about *how* something is made.\n\n### Design\n\n**The \"design\" part of this model is about aesthetics.** What makes a painting look good? What is it about a great logo that makes it so iconic? How is a musical piece composed to illicit an emotional response in the listener? What flavors of a culinary dish combine in just the right way to maximize each food's flavor?\n\nIf craft answers, \"*how's* it made?\", then design answers, \"*what* makes it appealing?\"\n\nDesign should engage at least one, but ideally more, of the five senses. It is empirical in nature. People tend to use \"design\" to refer to visuals, but there's no reason for such a restriction.\n\n### Art\n\nNow the big one filled with the most contention. What is \"art\" in this model? Art is made when a creative work is imbued with meaning.\n\nArt answers, \"*why* was it made?\" Alternatively, art enters the equation when nuances are added for very particular reasons. **Art is the purpose behind a work that offers purpose and meaning.**\n\nDa Vinci's *Virtuvian Man* is simply an anatomical study drawing done in pen and ink on water color paper (craft). Add to that the careful proportions and interesting placement of the overlapping arms and legs within the square and circle, and you have an interesting composition (design). However, once you consider the symbolism of circles and squares, you start to find deeper meaning (art).\n\nThis also means there are many creative works that would not qualify as art. The Hobby Lobby paint by numbers are excellent examples of crafts, because it instructs the painter on how to paint and what colors to use. There's an inherent design to the original creator of the stencil, but the consumer who paints at home and hangs a nice, homemade painting in her kitchen has done neither art nor design.\n\nInterestingly, this also means there may be a lot of art without a great focus on masterful craftsmanship. More examples of each will be explored in future posts exploring the merits and shortcomings.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI've been testing this tripartite model of creativity for a number of years on-and-off. So far, it's held up to the passing scrutiny raised. With more serious investigation, I may find weaknesses or caveats that need addressed, but for now, it holds up.\n\n> **tl:dr;** in creative works, the \"craft\" is *how* something is made technically, the \"design\" is *what* makes it aesthetically appealing, and the \"art\" is *why* something was made.\n\nWhat do you think? What variations of creativity can you think of that this model describes well? What examples fail? Let me know on social media.\n\nKeep thinkin', folks.","src/content/blog/creativity-series.md","71fc7f5832017927",{"html":309,"metadata":310},"\u003Ch1 id=\"creativity-series\">Creativity Series\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Over the years, I’ve been developing \u003Ca href=\"https://xkcd.com/927/\" title=\"Because who doesn&#x27;t like standards?\">my own mental model\u003C/a> for conceptualizing creative work and how to analyze them.

[Wix](https://www.wix.com/), [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/), [Webflow](https://webflow.com/), etc. are all excellent examples of this (and many more exist).\n\nI've been dreaming up a custom page builder for our own products as well. One significant challenge that presents itself is making the time for R&D. While the value is recognized, there's still enough work to slow my brainstorming and experimenting. That also means, in order to accomplish this R&D, I must do it on my own time. Not a terrible solution, but difficult to implement for similar reasons. (I'd like to be a present husband and father 😁)\n\n## Technical Challenges\n\nSome additional technical challenges that I've been considering: SSR setup, integration with Vue for reactive UIs, defining intuitive data contexts (e.g. Pinia store, other flux-like stores), and defining a light-enough data schema for storing the definitions.\n\n### SSR Setup\n\nA modern front-end tool like Vue.js (or React, or Svelte, etc.) seems the right tool for the job here, at least regarding the interactive building part (\"Edit\" mode). However, actually rendering the page (\"View\" mode) should be done on the server for better page load times and, if applicable, better SEO indexing.\n\nIn many of the dashboard apps I tend to build at ITI (and previous places of employment), SEO has rarely been a requirement. They're almost always behind a login, so no bots can reach them by design.\n\nImproving page rendering is always a good practice, much like RWD. It's best when we just bake the practice into our development habits. However, I've been in an unhealthy space with this regard. We want fast page load times, certainly, but we often settle for \"good enough.\" Some days I'm frustrated by this, but admittedly, other days it's quite fine. I cannot imagine this is unique to me.\n\n[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React) and [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/) (Vue) are great options for SSR projects. So much comes baked in. Depending on tech stack requirements, either are great options.\n\nAn alternative approach would be to use whatever existing server-side languages are available. Go, PHP, Python, C#, Ruby, etc. can take and interpret the defined page schema and render static HTML. The only downside to choosing any of these tools is balancing it with whatever reactivity and hydration needs the front-end has with the rendered markup. Not a blocker, but devs must be aware of the hurdle.\n\n### Integration with Vue for Reactivity\n\nI'm a huge fan of Vue.js. When I started dipping into the front-end soup of options, Angular 2 had just come out, and React was a new kid. Vue was even newer (still in v1 at the time, but v2 was just about to drop).\n\nI had tried Angular.js (v1) and liked it, but the shift to v2 was jarring, and I was very new to TypeScript still. I also had been resisting build systems on the front-end for a while. I only just started using Grunt/Gulp; my reception was tepid. On to React.\n\nJSX was immediately distasteful. I really didn't care for mixing HTML into JS. (I would later come to appreciate what it was accomplishing and warmed to the tech.) I also wasn't thrilled with how integral the build step was for new adopters. I bookmarked it as a maybe and moved to Vue.js\n\nIn Vue.js, I was thrilled that my two biggest complaints were not near requirements. **I didn't *need* a build step**, and I could keep my markup, styles, and logic separate. It wouldn't take me long to get into the single-file component \".vue\" pattern and end up adopting build systems, but this was the warm invitation I needed.\n\nSince then, I've guzzled the Vue.js kool-aid and loved component-based front-end UI architectures. I eventually returned to React and appreciated better what it was doing, but I still don't like CSS-in-JS approaches…\n\nThat said, **I want Vue-flavored data reactivity in my page builder.** This presents a challenging hurdle. It's not difficult to bind attributes to a given HTML element or Vue component. `v-bind` does so trivially. Binding events is a bit more complicated. How will the function be defined and included in the proper context for `v-on` to bind it?\n\n### Reactive Data Context\n\nSimilarly, how will this context be defined? Will it be a global store a la Pinia? Can it be scoped to the runtime component alone? Should I use provide/inject to define and access functions? Such are the trials & tribulations of client-side state management and event handling.\n\nOne WIP idea is to provide a way to define Pinia stores (or even custom-defined stores with `ref`, `computed`, and `reactive`) that are accessible for any given page. This leads to the question, \"How will the user who builds the page define those stores?\" Another UI would be required to support Pinia store-building in a no/low-code UI.","src/content/blog/super-dynamic-apps.md","0c0eba9ded74684e",{"html":372,"metadata":373},"\u003Ch1 id=\"super-dynamic-apps\">Super Dynamic Apps\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>In my current work, I’m responsible for making our web apps &#x26; sites highly configurable so that each client can (mostly) custom tailor our products to their wants/needs.

This series is designed to help me **test my assumptions and the utility of the framework** in a variety of creative disciplines.\n\nIt will begin by being applied to more traditional forms of creativity like painting, music, and writing. As the framework is tested and refined, more examples will be considered in less-traditional fields of creativity (e.g. software development, entrepreneurship, or science).\n\n## The Framework\n\nThe framework is composed of three parts: craft, design, and art. Much like Aristotle's various frameworks, e.g. [the four causes](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-causality/) or [modes of persuasion](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-rhetoric/), this framework's goal is to provide a multifaceted way to look at creative works in a holistic manner.\n\n> This framework's goal is to provide a multifaceted way to look at creative works in a holistic manner.\n\nHere is the initial framework:\n\n- **craft**: the process of how to make something given certain materials or processes\n- **design**: the process of organizing the components of the work in an aesthetically pleasing manner\n- **art**: the process of imbuing the work with meaning, purpose, and/or value\n\n### Craft\n\n**The process of how to make something given certain materials or processes.**\n\nThe combo of \"arts and crafts\" conjures mental images of Hobby Lobby and Jo-Ann Fabrics. A looser definition of the term \"art\" will include some paintings for sale, and several books on Bob Ross _plein air_ painting instruction books.\n\nHowever, I'm proposing this only scratches (pun intended) at the craft of creative works. It deals with the _how-to_ of painting, drawing, sculpting, and modeling.\n\nThis is not derisive towards craft. It is an essential part of generating creative work. Without the craft, there is nothing to observe.\n\nPainters need to know how to mix paint. Musicians need to know how to finger their instrument. Writers need to know how to write legibly and occasionally rhyme words in a poem. Technical implementation details in _how something is made_ are quite important.\n\n### Design\n\n**The process of organizing the components of the work in an aesthetically pleasing manner.**\n\nGiven craft works out the technical details of _making_ some creative work, design is what makes it appealing and pleasurable to observe. How are the essential parts organized to make the work enjoyable? What does that mean?\n\nIn visual creative works, strong design means the visual components, shapes, and elements are composed in an appealing way. Their placement in the layout of the composition is intentional and facilitates what the creator intended. Scale can be used to indicate relative size to other elements or relative size to the observer. Color theory may be used to indicate mood, relationships of elements; red can be used to anger _and_ love.\n\nIn musical works, melody, harmony, and rhythm can create coherent and aesthetically pleasing songs. The way elements or instruments of the song interact with each other can create pleasing or dissonant combinations, which might reflect and underlying story appealingly. (Note that \"aesthetically pleasing\" might seem unattractive on its own, but the elements might contrast other elements in appeasing ways.)\n\n\\# TODO find example of appealing elements in a song that have been \"well-designed\"\n\nSimilarly, written works will use elements of the story like plot structure to reflect the theme of narrative being explored. Character development can be heart-wrenching and bittersweet or empowering and dynamic, all drawing the reader in to the story with attractive nuances. Narrative styles like mystery novels that build suspense and exciting clues at just the right time are well-designed stories.\n\nFor example, the building mystery and details grown throughout the narratives of stories like _Gone Girl_, _The Da Vinci Code_, and _The Silence of the Lambs_. Each story designs the reveal of details and twists-and-turns to keep drawing the reader in.\n\n### Art\n\n**The process of imbuing the work with meaning, purpose, and/or value.**\n\nSo if craft is _how something is made_, and design is _how something is organized_ for aesthetic appeal, what is art? I fully expect this to be the main point of contention for those considering this framework. Or asked another way, **what makes something art?**\n\nWhen a creative work has symbolism and meaning _breathed_ into the work to enable it to be something more than its _prima facie_ portrayal, it becomes art. An Annunciation painting of Gabriel and Mary might just be an illustration of a biblical scene. However, once the elements are added in their rich symbolism, the painting becomes more art than illustration.\n\nThe flower being the Word given to Mary, in Gabriel's hand means she has not yet been impregnated, or in her hand, she is with child (and the variations in between). This rich symbolism and meaning speaks to a deeper story being told in the painting.\n\nBeethoven's 5th Symphony and its legendary motif used in the beginning of the song (and throughout): bum bum bum buuuum. The \"Fate knocking at the door\" motif \"a large-scale narrative of victory and defeat, of the eternal human struggle with fate, of sorrow and redemption\" (Source: [Warning Classics](https://www.warnerclassics.com/release/beethoven-symphony-no-5-fate-knocking-door))\n\nIn literature, complex themes might provide metaphors for real-world instances of abstract concepts shared in the story. George Orwell's _1984_ uses \"Big Brother\" as a symbol of oppressive, totalitarian, and surveillance. Thought-provoking themes in literature don't just challenge the reader to consider the proposed ideas, but also to put one's self in the position and ask, \"How would I respond?\"\n\n## Future Exploration\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this post is only introducing the three-part framework I've outlined here. Future posts will explore more instances of how this framework applies to other creatives works and how versatile it can be.\n\nThe shortcomings and challenges of the framework will also be considered. Particularly, what instances do not fit so nicely within this framework and why? How does culture affect the framework, or how do varying interpretations apply to what makes a creative work \"art?\"\n\nLinks will be provided to this post as more content becomes available.\n\nThank you so much for reading!","src/content/blog/creativity/01-three-part-framework.md","a044e4c5e098cde5",{"html":447,"metadata":448},"\u003Cp>In an effort to try and categorize the sometimes nebulous and ever-shifting definition of creative works, I’ve developed a three-part framework for considering creative works.

I love not worrying about mocking implementations of services and mocking the API response instead. It's brilliant.\n\n## The Issue\n\nI frequently find myself having a similar problem though, which is entirely on my end. I keep getting requests returning my markup instead of the desired JSON data. That obviously causes bad requests or handling of data. For example…\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n    \u003Cimg src=\"/images/blog/msw-reminder--example-JSON-parse.jpg\" alt=\"Example JSON Parse Result\">\n    \u003Cimg src=\"./images/msw-reminder--example-JSON-parse.jpg\" alt=\"Example JSON Parse Result\">\n    \u003Cfigcaption>Example JSON Parse Result\u003Cfigcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n## The Solution\n\nThe source of my problem relatively simple: **I'm making requests too soon.**\n\nMy current setup is to call `worker.start()` inside of a helper function that only optionally loads the MSW resources. This helps keep my production bundle size smaller. There is also a way to wait for the service worker to finish loading so that my particular problem doesn't happen.\n\n[Kent C. Dodds had this issue addressed in Issue 73](https://github.com/mswjs/msw/issues/73), which reminded me of how to wait for the workers to be ready. Specifically, [@kettanaito](https://github.com/kettanaito)'s [answer](https://github.com/mswjs/msw/issues/73#issuecomment-601584127) shows that the `start()` method is async and needs to be `await`ed in order for requests to follow correctly. Of course!\n\nI then found my most recent troublemaker in this instance of the problem. I was overly ambitious in making one of my modules (which makes the problem request) fetching data too early. It looks something like this:\n\n```ts\nimport { computed } from 'vue';\nimport { getConfig } from './getConfig';\n\n// 👇 the line that's calling too early\nconst config = getConfig(); // Promise\u003CConfig> where Config is a reactive Vue object\n\nconst origin = computed(() => config?.someOrigin ?? '');\nconst link = computed(() => `${origin.value}/${endpoint}`);\n\nexport function useLink() {\n    // … some caching logic for the config to only need to fetch it once…\n\n    return link;\n};\n```\n\nThe solution ended up being simple this time. I just needed to move the initial fetch of the config to the `useLink()` composable so that it would be called after MSW's load finishes.\n\n```ts\nimport { computed } from 'vue';\nimport { getConfig } from './getConfig';\n\n// 👇 the line that's calling too early\nconst { config, execute } = getConfig(); // refactored as a composable to return the reactive config, which will be updated once execute() finishes\n\nconst origin = computed(() => config?.someOrigin ?? '');\nconst link = computed(() => `${origin.value}/${endpoint}`);\n\nexport function useLink() {\n    // … some caching logic for the config to only need to fetch it once…\n    \n    execute(); // just letting this resolve behind the scenes; the \n    return link;\n};\n```\n\nAdmittedly, I chopped up my original code somewhat to preserve private code, but this is the essence of the situation. Using a combo of reactivity and making calls at the right time, I could refactor to allow MSW to finish loading, which then allows the mocked config request to be handled by MSW.\n\n**The takeaway**: don't make requests before they're ready to be handled in MSW.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nI know this is a dev-setup issue and isn't likely to be relevant in production or even dev-server testing (i.e. non-localhost). The API from which I fetch the config will already be up and running, so this is a moot issue regarding that.\n\nHowever, I use MSW a **lot**, and it's great to remember with clarity why I've run into this issue in the past. Hopefully by writing this post, I'll remind myself and/or cement the knowledge in memory better.\n\nHope this helps, dear anonymous reader!","src/content/blog/msw-reminder.md","22369270ed764e2e",{"html":494,"metadata":495},"\u003Ch1 id=\"mock-service-worker-reminder\">Mock Service Worker Reminder\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>I’ve been using Mock Service Worker (MSW) for a couple of years now, and it’s really been a game-changer.

This works in most cases, which is excellent. It's short and easy to read. Win.\n\n## Async Behavior\n\nHowever, not all async behaviors are so easily handled. In many of my components, especially view components with dynamic data tables fetching data from APIs, I must wait for data to return from the server in order to assert my expectations.\n\nThis might be as simple as fetching the data and ensuring I have the column count expected, displayed data is formatted correctly (e.g. phone numbers, money amounts, etc.), or that individual row actions are displaying as they should. It may be as complicated as interacting with the table and ensuring toast messages, error alerts, or other user feedback is displayed. That often requires multiple requests.\n\n## My Solution\n\nMy solution has been to handle the changes I want to test for, then emit custom events from the component that are used (sometimes exclusively) by the testing code. Pretend we have a page like `RecordLookup` that performs basic CRUD operations on records.\n\nLet's say the events will be `load`, `record-create`, `record-update`, `update-error`, & `record-delete`. \n\n**Note:** I'm not using past-tense in order to mimic native DOM events like `click` instead of `clicked`.\n\nUsing MSW, I am able to make async requests that take longer than the 10-ish ms  that `nextTick()` typically takes. This means we cannot rely on only the `await` keyword. In addition to that, we don't have a reference to the promise that will be awaited when the data returns. \n\nThis means **setting callbacks on custom events**. This can be done through VTU's prop bindings.\n\nThis also means **I cannot rely on the regular callback signature** for Vitest's `test` function (I prefer the `it` alias). This is where the [Done Callback](https://vitest.dev/guide/migration.html#done-callback) comes into play.\n\nFurthermore, I must be sure to handle exceptions in the test code, which is usually how the failed tests are communicated.\n\n```ts\ndescribe('Record Lookup', () => {\n    it('should load records automatically', () => new Promise((done, fail) => {\n        const wrapper = mount(RecordLookup, {\n            props: {\n                // I prefer to keep the wrapper portion as small as possible\n                // for easier reading/skimming. When it gets too big, I have\n                // trouble keeping track of block endings.\n                // Moving the expectation code to another function also lets\n                // me handle the promise more simply.\n                onLoaded: checkForData().then(done).catch(fail),\n            },\n        });\n        async function checkForData() {\n            // some assertion code to check that rows exist, no error/empty msg \n            // is displaying, etc.\n        }\n    }));\n});\n```\n\nThe other events discussed can be handled similarly, and each custom event listener must handle errors. Only the final callback needs the `done` (or `resolve` if you follow ESLint) callback called.\n\n```ts\nit('should delete a record', () => new Promise((done, fail) => {\n    const wrapper = mount(RecordLookup, {\n        props: {\n            // Remember: the data is auto-fetched when mounted & \"loaded\" emits.\n            onLoaded: deleteRecord().catch(fail),\n            // Notice the quoted key; the custom event is converted into\n            // \"on{Snake-case-name}\" with multiple word event names.\n            'onRecord-delete': confirmDeletion.then(done).catch(fail),\n        },\n    });\n    async function deleteRecord() {\n        // …\n    }\n    async function confirmDeletion() {\n        // expect deleted record is no longer in the table\n    }\n}));\n```\n\nHandling custom events this way allows me to test async behaviors extensively from Vitest alone (for better or worse). Using custom events and handlers can help keep components from being tested by their implementation and instead rely on input/output pairings that remain decoupled from implementation details.\n\nHit me up on the socials if you have feedback, criticisms, or improvements that can be made to this process. I've not covered all the nuances that I have on a given test case, but this illustrates the idea well enough. Also let me know if you're interested in more scenarios/examples you'd like to see.\n\nHappy testing, devs!","src/content/blog/testing-components-async.md","7943f432d1e4cf6b",{"html":523,"metadata":524},"\u003Ch1 id=\"testing-components-with-async-behaviors\">Testing Components with Async Behaviors\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>In my normal dev setup, I’m using \u003Ca href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">Vue.js\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"https://vite.dev/\">Vite\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"https://vitest.dev/\">Vitest\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"https://mswjs.io/\">MSW.js\u003C/a> (I wrote about \u003Ca href=\"/blog/msw-lessons/\">some MSW lessons\u003C/a> recently too), and \u003Ca href=\"https://test-utils.vuejs.org/\">@vue/test-utils\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Vue Test Utils (VTU) is particularly helpful when dealing with interacting with components and the DOM, e.g. clicking buttons or triggering key events.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"ts\">\u003Ccode>\u003Cspan class=\"line\">\u003Cspan style=\"color:#F97583\">await\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> wrapper.\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#B392F0\">find\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">'button'\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">).\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#B392F0\">trigger\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">(\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">'click'\u003C/span>\u003Cspan style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">);\u003C/span>\u003C/span>\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>Internally, \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/test-utils/blob/6332d7c434fd9d4e10a61a821ae27c7778bc397f/src/baseWrapper.ts#L366\">VTU uses Vue’s \u003Ccode>nextTick()\u003C/code>\u003C/a> to dispatch the event and wait for the \u003Ca href=\"https://vuejs.org/api/general#nexttick\">next tick\u003C/a>.

I thought, \"Oh great, one more dependency to manage and learn.\" After reading through the article and skimming the docs site, I was curious enough to try it. I had a series of green field projects ramping up where I could refine my use of it. I didn't know how much I'd fall in love with it.\n\n## Why Mock APIs?\n\nThe projects where I used MSW were front-end SPAs with a C# API back-end. While I know enough C# to make changes or build front-of-the-back-end libraries, I don't build full APIs in C# regularly enough to do it fast. This was a time where being fast was very valuable. (I'm also not a keen fan of .NET's way of handling things. It's not terrible. It's just not my preferred flavor.)\n\nSo I got to mocking the API instead and found a number of benefits.\n\n### Early API Design\n\nMy current pattern is to review the Figma designs and step through the flow of the screens. I comment in the designs or take notes in my markdown notes as I go. **The key is to identify where I expect requests will need to be made.**\n\nAs I make note of which requests I expect are needed, I also make an initial design of the request body \"shape.\" This allows me to (1) collaborate with the back-end developer(s) and (2) build an initial API mock so I can get started right away. No need to wait on the actual API.\n\n### Rapid Early Iteration\n\nGiven the API endpoint and payloads are at least initially designed, I can now start writing the actual service functions that will make the request for data. Once I switch to using the actual API, if the design doesn't change, these functions need not change.\n\nThis is also where one of my other favorite tools comes into play: [faker.js](https://fakerjs.dev/api/). I need to return some kind of data, often complex, when I make these mock requests. I also need more than a couple of rows. We often have paginated data tables, so I need 20-50 records of relatively unique data.\n\nI write a script to generate the dummy data based on the expected response data, then in the MSW endpoint handler script, I import that JSON, cache it (so data is updated between requests), and return it to the UI.\n\n```js\nimport fs from 'fs';\nimport path from 'path';\nimport { faker } from '@faker-js/faker';\n\n// example generator script\nfunction generateTransaction() {\n    // mock the data as needed using faker\n    // …\n    return {…};\n}\n\n// … other implementation code; when simple enough, I can have AI do a lot of\n\n/**\n * @param {Array} dataToWrite Array of data to write to file\n */\nfunction writeToFile(dataToWrite) {\n    const fileName = path.resolve('src/mocks/TransactionDetails.all.json');\n    fs.writeFile(fileName, JSON.stringify(dataToWrite, null, 2), (err) => {\n        if (err)\n            throw err;\n        console.log('File written successfully!');\n    });\n}\n\nwriteToFile(callNTimes(generateTransaction, 55));\n```\n\n### Unit Test Compatibility\n\nThese mocked endpoints also make unit testing fairly straight forward. I can still simulate the behavior to test it. I often emit events from components once data has loaded, is being fetched, and when POST/PUT/PATCH requests succeed or fail. That way, in the test, I can listen for those events and make assertions.\n\n### Web Socket Testing\n\nVery recently, [MSW began supporting Web Sockets](https://mswjs.io/docs/basics/handling-websocket-events/). This was excellent timing, as one of our products began using web sockets to live update its data tables based on when records were coming in, going out, or being updated.\n\nSome extra testing setup was necessary to manually trigger web socket events, but it all works great. (I grab the socket connection, send my own event to the \"server,\" and that triggers an update event to be handled by the UI.)\n\n## Challenges\n\n### Maintenance\n\n**Maintaining the mocked API is the greatest challenge, just as it would be with mocking services.** Once changes happen in the real API, disciplined devs must remember to update the mocks and tests. When these stagnate and become out of sync, it causes issues in automated tests and localhost development.\n\nIt's fairly common that the API contract will update during development, so I must keep my mocks up-to-date as well. This is to be expected now.\n\n### Conditional Loading\n\nUpon monitoring the bundled assets, I discovered that MSW was being included in my production bundles. This was unacceptable.\n\nTo avoid this, I wrote a helper function that can be called from the `main.ts` script (e.g. `maybeLoadMocks()`). Within that helper, I check environment variables for whether or not the APIs should be mocked (e.g. assuming Vite, `VITE_MOCK_API=true`). If true, I use a dynamic import to fetch the MSW init code.\n\n```ts\n// maybeLoadMocks.ts\n\n// imported from constants so vitest can stub them\nimport { isDev, shouldMockAPI } from '@/constants';\n\nexport const shouldLoadMocks = isDev && shouldMockAPI;\n\nexport async function maybeLoadMocks() {\n    if (!shouldLoadMocks)\n        return;\n\n    const { useMocks } = await import('../mocks/useMocks');\n    useMocks();\n}\n\n// useMocks.ts\nimport { worker } from '@/mocks/browser';\n\nexport function useMocks() {\n    worker.start({\n        onUnhandledRequest(request, print) {\n            const url = new URL(request.url);\n            // By convention, our APIs start with \"/api/v{number}\"\n            if (/^\\/api\\/v\\d+/.test(url.pathname) === false)\n                return;\n\n            print.warning();\n        },\n    });\n}\n```\n\n## Main Takeaways\n\n- Early API planning reveals blind spots and faulty assumptions when there's time to fix them.\n- Early API planning also forces a closer look at mockups/designs to solve problems early.\n- Early working API designs enables rapid iteration and development, including early unit testing.\n- Maintenance requires intentionality.\n- Bundles should be checked regularly.\n\nThese have been really great lessons, and my experience with MSW has been awesome. I highly recommend trying [MSW (Mock Service Worker)](https://mswjs.io/) in your next project, especially if you're on a team and are not responsible for writing the API. \n\nIt may even be helpful for full stack devs depending on which side you start building first. I've noticed building more complex request handlers has allowed me to make changes or catch things the API would encounter in low-impact settings. No expensive cloud functions or database involvement required.\n\nHappy building, friends 🙂","src/content/blog/msw-lessons.md","30835d3ee1277ec8",{"html":551,"metadata":552},"\u003Ch1 id=\"msw-lessons\">MSW Lessons\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>A little over a year ago, I read an article (\u003Ca href=\"https://kentcdodds.com/blog/stop-mocking-fetch\">I think by Kent Dodds\u003C/a>) about \u003Ca href=\"https://mswjs.io/\">MSW (Mock Service Worker)\u003C/a> that recommended mocking API calls instead of mocking service functions/classes to grab data.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I initially found this suggestion dubious.

I've always wanted to understand how these cool features work. I've never really known the term(s) for them until recently. Here's how I started using it on this site.\n\n## Learning the Term\n\nI began by searching Google for things like \"floating nodes js,\" \"floating dots js,\" and similar searches, but anything with \"nodes\" gave me Node.js results (no surprise) and others were not helpful either. I then tried Grok and described the behavior the best I could. This produced helpful results. The following was my prompt…\n\n> Context: HTML canvas element & JS\n> \n> What's it called when a canvas element has animated nodes (pin points like stars) floating around that draw lines to each other when they're close enough?\n\n… and part of Grok's reply witht he helpful bits…\n\n> What you're describing is commonly referred to as a \"particle network\" or \"connected particles animation\" in the context of an HTML canvas element and JavaScript.…\n\nNow I had my terms. With a few confirmation searches using \"particle network\" to ensure it wasn't hallucinating, I began researching some GitHub & blogged options.\n\n## Experimenting\n\nI searched through the options available, and there are some tutorials for creating this myself, which I will certainly be doing in the future for my own learning/leveling-up. For now, I just want a quick addition to get started and will refine from there. I landed on the [decade-old `canvas-particle-network`](https://github.com/JulianLaval/canvas-particle-network). It's easy to get running quickly, which is what I was after. It won't give me everything I want, so I can either fork the repo or start from scratch elsewhere, but again, this is just to get up and running.\n\nI dropped a copy of the script in my `/public` folder (the npm package didn't have TypeScript definitions working quite right when I tried installing from there, so I left the copy+paste version in place). One trick to playing with canvas is never knowing when it's rendering the canvas or not, so I (1) set the `body` background to red (`#a00`) and the canvas background passed to the library to a darker red (`#300`). This told me which was rendering.\n\nOnce it started rendering the particle network nodes and edges, I unset the reds and played with the colors & nodes of the particles.\n\n## Giving It A Home\n\nNow that I had the settings I liked, I took the time to make a separate component for the particle network to handle logic like init, a11y settings (see below), and when to load the script.\n\n### Accessibility (a11y)\n\nSeeing it all, I noticed it's *a lot* of movement. I know about (but don't often use) the `prefers-reduced-motion` feature. This was a great chance to play more with it.\n\n`window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)')` returns an object and `.matches` provides a boolean for the setting.\n\n```js\nconst reducedMotionMediaQuery = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)');\nif (!reducedMotionMediaQuery.matches) {\n    startAnimation();\n}\n```\n\nCouple this with the handy `change` event listener, and I can toggle the start/stop of the animation.\n\n```js\nconst reducedMotionMediaQuery = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)');\nif (!reducedMotionMediaQuery.matches) {\n    startAnimation();\n}\nreducedMotionMediaQuery.addEventListener('change', (event) => {\n    if (event.matches) {\n        stopAnimation();\n    } else {\n        startAnimation();\n    }\n});\n```\n\nIn future iterations (i.e. when I build my own), I'd like to set a fade transition for when it starts/stops the animation. Perhaps a callback for when the transition completes as well. Also, a method to start and stop the animation would be a great improvement.\n\nI also added a mostly opaque background color to the content space to avoid floating particles/edges from distracting from reading. I used *some* transparency though, because frankly, I'm a sucker for see-through effects. An additional `box-shadow` with a generous spread helps it fade a bit. This content background only shows when the effect is active though.\n\n## Wrap Up\n\nSo that wraps my report for the new particle network feature running in the background!

The following is a brief update on the work I've been doing on my website to update the Particle Network background effect that's probably floating around (pun intended). Read part 1 if you're interested.\n\nThe updates I've made:\n\n- theme toggle control (separate but related)\n- theme sensitivity\n- custom implementation\n\nLet's dig in!\n\n## Theme Toggle Control\n\nI added a theme toggle control (in the bottom right if I haven't moved it yet). Okay, okay, technically it's \"dark mode/light mode\" toggling; whatever. The animation effect on toggling is one of those fun little flairs I just love adding. The first implementation was fine, but I discovered during the Particle Network update that I had mixed unrelated code…\n\n![Shame Gif](https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExeWs4Zmxka2xkZDNiMmoyOXE4OWpvdWVybjBremNuOG8yYjNnZTMwMiZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/pDsCoECKh1Pa/giphy.gif)\n\nSo I moved that code to the toggle component where it belongs.\n\nOne funny whoops I ran into was forgetting which CSS library I've been using. I built this site using [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/) to provide me with… well, very simple CSS styling. Bootstrap is a classic, and I could have gone that route, but I was looking for something simpler and lighter.\n\nTailwind is great in a lot of ways and *really* verbose in the markup. I wanted to keep it lighter still. I haven't done a complex analytical comparison between both implementations, so I don't know if it's actually simpler and lighter or not.\n\nWhat I *thought* I was using was [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/), another minimal style library that appeals to my interest in just using semantic HTML and making it look good. I like Pico's theme handling approach (for the most part). I fought with my site for a while before I realized I am still using Simple rather than Pico. That explains why the theming features weren't working as expect. 😅\n\n> It's the little things filling your day that will stoke or suffocate your passions.\n\nOne additional change regarding the theme toggle styles I made was to move the updated CSS variables from the `html` tag's inline styles into a dynamically-generated `style` tag. I check for the tag's existence, create and append it if missing, then set the `innerHTML` of the tag. this cleans up the devtool's rendered Elements tag perhaps an arbitrary amount, but enough that *I* like it. I also [re-]learned a fun concise way to create the element if it's not present.\n\n```js\nconst styleId = 'someStyles';\nconst style = document.head.querySelector(`#${styleId}`)\n    ?? Object.assign(document.createElement('style'), { id: styleId });\n```\n\nIt's a silly thing, but doesn't that `Object.assign` remind you a little of jQuery's classically awesome element creation overload? Y'know, the one that looks like this: \n\n```js\n$('\u003Cstyle>', { id: styleId })\n```\n\nWhat a gem. Fond memories. It's the little things filling your day that will stoke or suffocate your passions.\n\n## Theme Sensitivity\n\nNow that I have theme toggle controls, I wanted to make the Particle Network more sensitive. I was brute forcing the theme toggle controls initially (i.e. stopping/starting the lib). I built into the library (upon rewriting it - see below) the ability to update the options and have those changes update the canvas immediately. Not much to it!\n\nOne additional benefit to this update was to locate the \"source of truth\" regarding styles in CSS where I want it and not repeat data that easily falls out-of-sync otherwise. Specifically, the background and particle colors are being set when the theme updates, and I'm grabbing those computed colors when the Particle Network (Astro component) notices the change. It looks something like this:\n\n```js\nconst computedStyle = getComputedStyle(document.documentElement);\nconst particleNetworkOptions = {\n    particleColor: computedStyle.getPropertyValue('--particle'),\n    background: computedStyle.getPropertyValue('--bg'),\n};\n```\n\nThis way, when it gets set and the options need updated, this code can run and just grab the correct values.\n\n## Custom Implementation\n\nThis goal had two facets: (1) to learn the thought process of the Particle Network better and (2) to gain greater control over a cool-but-outdated library. That control is what enabled me to build in the option update and others.\n\nI admit I started the rewrite with some AI help. That rewrote the older code into a TypeScript class for me. Then I picked my way through and cleaned up the unnecessary and hallucinated code. This helped me get familiar with, customize, and study the library more.\n\nThis just seems like one of those features I'll be iterating on over the months and maybe years, so I expect more articles like this discussing updates and lessons learned.\n\n## Wrap Up\n\nSome things I've valued most about this update:\n\n- deeper learning & customization of the Particle Network code\n- integration (and with looser coupling) of independent site components\n- clearly defined \"source of truth\" for styles and a relatively inexpensive way to access them (there *is* some perf cost but not enough to worry)\n\nUntil next time!

After a few attempts that established it wasn't a totally trivial affair, I gave it some time and finally buckled down. This post will explore the `web-camera` component I made, which requests access to your device's web cam, displays a stream of video, and captures photos to a canvas element. Let's get started.\n\n## What Are Web Components?\n\nWeb components (wc) are a way of authoring reusable code that typically involves at least one of the following web APIs: [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements), [shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM), [templates, and slots](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_templates_and_slots). [Learn more about them at MDN.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) Additionally, [Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com/tag/webcomponents/) has written extensively about this topic.\n\nOne retroactive reason I'm such a big fan of Vue.js has been how much it's helped build a foundation of knowledge surrounding these topics. All component libraries (Vue, React, Angular, Svelte, etc.) help teach the value of custom elements. To the extent that any of them enable devs to write styles scoped to the component, they imperfectly illustrate the shadow DOM as well. Vue specifically uses `template` and `slot` in its SFCs (single-file components), which was helpful as a sort of [\"near-transfer\" of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_of_learning#Transfer_taxonomies).\n\n```html\n\u003C!-- ButtonLoader.vue -->\n\u003C!-- Vue uses `template` to define markup in .vue files; wc do the same -->\n\u003Ctemplate>\n  \u003C!-- Vue's short-hand click listener to bubble the event up -->\n  \u003Cbutton @click=\"$emit('click', $event)\">\n    \u003C!-- `loading` could be a Vue prop; wc -->\n    \u003Cspan v-show=\"loading\" class=\"btn-loader\" aria-label=\"Button Loading…\">\u003C/span>\n    \u003C!-- \"Default\" slot when unspecified; true for both Vue and wc -->\n    \u003Cslot>\u003C/slot>\n  \u003C/button>\n\u003C/template>\n```\n\nOne caveat I've noticed so far has been that native web components don't (currently) support data binding to slots, so if you want to pass specific data to a slot, you'll have to figure out a different way. I have not explored this much beyond the initial discovery, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\n```html\n\u003Ctemplate>\n  \u003Cbutton>\n    \u003C!-- Vue ✅ wc ❌ -->\n    \u003Cslot :foo=\"foo\">\u003C/slot>\n  \u003C/button>\n\u003C/template>\n```\n\n## My Dependencies\n\nTypeScript & Vite for bundling and type safety/help; modern browsers\n\nFor my `web-camera` component, I used TypeScript for type safety/helpers and Vite to bundle the files. Technically, this could all be done with vanilla JS and no bundler too. The primary downside there is the async needed to fetch the markup and a way to reliably reference the markup path. See more below for my [file organization](#file-organization).\n\nAnother dependency is obviously a modern browser with support of the features being used. I've not tested the limits of each browser, but I recall that Safari is slow to adopt of of the web component features. Depending on how bought-in your component is, there may be no issue.\n\n## File Organization\n\nTo begin, I've been organizing my component files via co-location just like I do in Vue. Minimally (depending on the complexity of the markup), there are 2 files: web-camera.ts & web-camera.html. These usually live in a directory named accordingly:\n\n```\n/web-camera\n  /web-camera.html\n  /web-camera.ts\n```\n\nThe reason for co-locating the web components in a directory named the same way is minimally two-fold:\n\n1. co-location within a folder encourages modularity (and prospective unit testing)\n2. naming the file(s) the same as the directory makes it easier to differentiate between multiple component files of the same extension (e.g. web-camera.ts vs index.ts or component.ts)\n\nIf a bundler is being used, another option is to add a `package.json` file the the following contents:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"main\": \"web-camera.ts\"\n}\n```\n\nThis style of authoring allows both #2 listed above *and* a bonus of cleaner/more concise import statements.\n\n```js\nimport { WebCamera } from '@/components/web-camera';\n// vs\nimport { WebCamera } from '@/components/web-camera/web-camera.ts';\n```\n\nOther helpful files can be defined here: `models.ts`, `constants.ts`, `events.ts`, etc. Also, any assets like images or fonts could be stored in this shared directory for easy access.\n\n## Markup Initialization\n\nThe TS file imports (and bundles via Vite) the HTML markup string, which is then instantiated as a DOM node(s). To do this, I create a `div` (detached from the DOM tree), set the `innerHTML` to the imported string, then grab the `firstChild`. That is attached to the component.\n\n```js\nimport templateStr from './web-camera.html?raw'; // ?raw is from Vite https://vite.dev/guide/assets#importing-asset-as-string\nconst div = document.createElement('div');\ndiv.innerHTML = templateStr;\nconst template = div.firstChild;\n// inside the component's constructor()…\n// if appending to light DOM\nthis.appendChild(templateEl.content.cloneNode(true));\n// if appending to shadow DOM\nthis.shadowRoot(templateEl.content.cloneNode(true));\n```\n\nI originally tried setting the component's innerHTML to the `templateStr`, but that risked losing slot contents and didn't work. `Document.parseHTMLUnsafe()` is another option, though the name is not inviting, but the instantiated DOM is deeper than a simple `div`. Surprisingly, document fragments don't work either. I've not gone deeper into exploring this and the reason why.\n\n```js\n// inside constructor()\nthis.innerHTML = templateStr; // nope\nDocument.parseHTMLUnsafe(templateStr).body.firstChild; // another option but meh\n```\n\n## Issues with Shadow DOM\n\nOne peculiar issue I haven't investigated occurred when trying to write to the `canvas` within the shadow DOM. I could stream the media device (webcam) to the `video` correctly, but when trying to capture a snapshot of the stream and draw it to the `canvas`, it didn't work until I removed use of the shadow DOM. There are quirks when dealing with the shadow DOM, so this wasn't totally surprising. I'd like to investigate this more some day, but it was not a rabbit trail for today.\n\n## Attributes & Events\n\n**Attributes** are the way to pass along Initialization options. Nothing is passed into the constructor. After calling `super()` within the `constructor()` method, the tag's attributes can be read.\n\n```ts\nclass WebCamera extends HTMLElement {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    this.getAttribute('data-foo') === 'bar'; // assumes \u003Cweb-camera data-foo=\"bar\">\u003C/web-camera>\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote that attributes read this way are always strings, so if they could be numbers, booleans, etc., they must be cast as such. More complex validation likely requires duck typing.\n\nSome version of data reactivity through attributes is available using `attributeChangedCallback()`. This is one of several [custom element lifecycle callbacks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements#custom_element_lifecycle_callbacks).\n\n```ts\nattributeChangedCallback(attrName: string, oldValue: string, newValue: string) {\n  if (attrName === 'foo') {\n    // handle newValue and maybe consider oldValue - possibly update an internal options object if helpful\n  }\n}\n```\n\nJust as props allow passing *in* information to the component in React, Vue, etc., attributes do the same for web components.\n\n**Events** similarly allow passing data *out* from the web component. Natively-defined events like `click`, `keyup`, and others can be emitted. Other options exist for custom events like the (surprise surprise) [`CustomEvent` class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent/CustomEvent) may be used.\n\nFor `web-camera`, I'm emitting some lifecycle events like `created` (called at the end of the constructor) and `mounted` (called at the end of `connectedCallback` life cycle hook). I also emit events when the video camera stream starts and stops, as well as when photos are captured (which includes the captured image in the `detail` detail map). Consumers can listen just like any other element.\n\n```js\ndocument.querySelector('web-camera')?.addEventListener('capture-frame', event => {…});\n```\n\n## Photo Handling\n\nAs mentioned, the photo capture emits an event (i.e. `capture-frame`) that can be handled. The photo can be extracted from here.\n\n```ts\ndocument.querySelector('web-camera')?.addEventListener('capture-frame', (event) => {\n  event.detail.image; // blob or base64 string\n});\n```\n\nAdditionally, if the photo is capture programmatically (like if the consumer wants to use custom-styled buttons or perform capture events invisibly, e.g. during an online test to detect fraud), the image will be returned from the method call.\n\n```ts\nconst image = await webCamera.captureFrame();\n```\n\nThe capture type can be defined via attribute. The capture format returns a `Blob` object by default, but a base64 encoded image can optionally be returned.\n\n```html\n\u003C!-- PNG Blob default -->\n\u003Cweb-camera>\u003C/web-camera>\n\u003C!-- JPG base64 -->\n\u003Cweb-camera capture-type=\"jpg\" capture-encoded=\"true\">\u003C/web-camera>\n\u003C!-- JPG base64; shorthand encoding opt-in -->\n\u003Cweb-camera capture-type=\"jpg\" capture-encoded>\u003C/web-camera>\n```\n\n## Potential Improvements\n\nOne idea I have for an improvement is to provide slot controls for the capture button, or any additional buttons. This isn't strictly necessary as the buttons can simply be hidden via CSS, but it would plausibly reduce the amount of markup floating around.\n\n```css\nweb-camera button { display: none; }\n```\n\nAnother far-out idea would be to figure out how to use photo/video filtering libraries and allow the user to toggle between different blend modes and filters like sepia, black & white, etc. I must test more with mobile devices and multiple streaming inputs to account for different cameras. Similarly, if I ever need to handle audio input, I'll need attributes factoring those in.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis has been tons-o-fun! I wrote this webcam library back in 2020 and love that I finally rewrote it with web components in mind. I look forward to building up a set of tools using web components and getting to know this excellent set of APIs better.\n\nA solid # TODO would be to implement some working examples here to provide better illustration of the web component in action.

It's been a long-held desire to get into the weeds, and I finally pulled the trigger. (Shout out to [Bruno Simon](https://x.com/bruno_simon)'s amazing [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/)!)\n\nOne concept I've been playing with to understand it better is displacement maps. I specifically wondered how I might shape terrain just by painting an image in real time. While I'm lacking the \"real time\" shaping (though it's not hard to see how I'd handle it), the painting part came together easily.\n\n## What Are Displacement Maps?\n\n> The displacement map affects the position of the mesh's vertices. Unlike other maps which only affect the light and shade of the material the displaced vertices can cast shadows, block other objects, and otherwise act as real geometry. The displacement texture is an image where the value of each pixel (white being the highest) is mapped against, and repositions, the vertices of the mesh. - [Three.js Docs](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=plane#api/en/materials/MeshStandardMaterial.displacementMap)\n\nA displacement map is a black-and-white image that affects the mesh vertices. White is up, black is down, and the amount of \"up\" is determined by the [`displacementScale` property](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=plane#api/en/materials/MeshStandardMaterial.displacementScale).\n\nThis means terrain can be \"built\" from a plane with enough triangles and a good displacement map.\n\n## My Play Examples\n\nTo get a sense of how this works and how easily it can be manipulated, I opened a photo editor and started painting.\n\n![displacement map example](./images/threejs-displacement/displacement-map.webp)\n\nThis goofy smiley is then applied to the scene's plane mesh and we get an equally goofy shape!\n\n```ts\nconst textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader();\nconst checkerTexture = textureLoader.load('/checkers.jpg');\nconst displacementMap = textureLoader.load('/displacement-map.webp');\nconst bumpMap = textureLoader.load('/bump-map.webp');\n// tiling requires some manual configuration; womp womp\ncheckerTexture.repeat.set(8, 8);\ncheckerTexture.wrapS = THREE.RepeatWrapping;\ncheckerTexture.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;\n\nconst planeGeometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(10, 10, 50, 50);\nconst planeMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({\n    color: 'white',\n    map: checkerTexture,\n    bumpMap,\n    displacementMap,\n    displacementScale: 1,\n});\n\nconst plane = new THREE.Mesh(planeGeometry, planeMaterial);\nplane.rotation.x = -Math.PI / 2;\nscene.add(plane);\n```\n\n![displaced mesh example](./images/threejs-displacement/displaced-mesh.webp)\n\nI also noticed my checker pattern is one column off from tiling correctly - whoops! (That's why some rows have extra wide blocks that make the whole tiled texture look columnated.)\n\n(Also, note to self: if Three.js examples become more common on my site, I'd like to have live interactive demo code.)\n\nNotice also the \"BK Displ.\" written text on the displacement map and how it translates to the mesh from the screenshot. It's not immediately clear that's what's written on the map. That's because the poly count is not high enough, and perhaps the resolution of the map is too low. More tinkering would reveal which/both.\n\n## More Common Examples\n\nDisplacement maps (and bump maps, which are much smaller, i.e. for bumps) usually align with their color textures. For example, this brick texture…\n\n![brick texture](./images/threejs-displacement/bricks-texture-map.webp)\n\n… should be used with this brick displacement map.\n\n![brick displacement map](./images/threejs-displacement/bricks-displacement-map.webp)\n\n([Brick example taken from Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/a/broken_brick_wall). [Props to Amal Kumar](https://polyhaven.com/all?a=Amal%20Kumar))\n\n## Wrap It Up, Chatty\n\nWhether you're adding extra detail to a scene/texture or literally shaping the scene's environment and landscape, displacement maps are an awesome tool in the tool belt. Learn its powers well, and the quality of your scenes will improve accordingly.\n\nHappy learning, all!","src/content/blog/learning-displacement-threejs.md",[709,710,711,712],"./images/threejs-displacement/displacement-map.webp","./images/threejs-displacement/displaced-mesh.webp","./images/threejs-displacement/bricks-texture-map.webp","./images/threejs-displacement/bricks-displacement-map.webp","a0b4ef49b646170e",{"html":715,"metadata":716},"\u003Ch1 id=\"threejs-learning-displacement-maps\">Three.js Learning: Displacement Maps\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>I’ve been learning Three.js more in-depth the past couple of weeks.

June 2025 presented the 'castle' challenge, but I was a bit unprepared and didn't appreciate the value of stating focused on an MVP (minimum viable \"project\" in this case).\n\nThis second challenge I'll attempt, I have been keeping my focus on the basics.\n\n## The Aquarium\n\n\u003Ca href=\"https://threejs-journey.com/challenges/019-aquarium\" target=\"_blank\">\n#019 Aquarium\n\n![019 Aquarium Three.js Challenge](./images/tjsj-019-aquarium.png)\n\u003C/a>\n\n\nThe theme is \"aquarium.\" I bounced around to several ideas initially, as is the nature of creative brainstorming. One Saturday morning, when at some family's house on the lake, my boys and I were surfing Pinterest. It has a great selection of wild, awesome concept art, impossible scenes, and surreal inspirations.\n\nWhat we discovered was in that vein of surrealism and fantastic. We saw whales and fish in cubes of water swimming through the air. We began dreaming up cool scenes and visual components.\n\n## Surreal Aquarium\n\nThe \"final\" project became a goofy, fun, [surreal aquarium](https://tjsj-aquarium.web.app/).\n\n![My Surreal Aquarium](./images/tjsj-019-surreal-aquarium.png)\n\nHere's how the project *developed*. 😉\n\n### Cubes and Spheres\n\nUpon implementing a cube, I discovered what's apparently a common issue: Three.js cubes are composed of 6 planes which have different vertexes along the edge. When I began animating the faces of the cube using a sin wave, the edges never stayed together. Womp womp.\n\nOnce I learned (with some help from our chatty robot friends at Grok and Gemini) that 6-faced issue with cubes, I shifted to using a sphere, which conceptually made better sense anyway.\n\nAdding the sin wave to the sphere completed a water bubble effect that's perfect for the swimming creature.\n\n### Staying Focused\n\nMy ideas kept running away with me, but I have forced to come back to the central idea: make your surreal aquarium with at least one fish and good lighting/textures/rendering and special FX.\n\nBy focusing on just accomplishing one thing at a time and keeping it small, I've been making good progress. There have been some tempting red herrings (no pun intended), but I remembered my castle fiasco and how I spent more time tinkering with how to move the castle pieces around instead of actually making a castle.\n\n### Environment\n\nOnce I finally got a fish ([see below for model credits](#credits)) that animates, grouped it with my sin wave bubble, and set an environment cube for the background, I noticed the bubble wasn't really reflecting the environment well. I've started with an environment map from Three.js to keep focused on the main parts. It's such a nice image, that I want the reflection to be nice too.\n\nBack to the LLMs for ideas, guidance, and experimental sources!\n\nYou can see the [fragment](https://github.com/Made-of-Clay/tjsj-19-aquarium/blob/dc67768592747282524a18059e6baf9c4345cf2b/src/waterCube.frag) and [vertex](https://github.com/Made-of-Clay/tjsj-19-aquarium/blob/dc67768592747282524a18059e6baf9c4345cf2b/src/waterCube.vert) shaders that the robots generated for me. 🤖\n\nNow the reflection on the bubble moves with the environment as the camera moves around.\n\nI did learn in the Three.js Journey Twitch stream (review of the projects) that a later course in Three.js Journey provides a better solution for the bubble. I'd like to cover that and return to the project to upgrade my bubble shader.\n\n### Swimming Fish\n\nAnimating the fish/bubble along a curve was tricky. After trying a few iterations, I concluded I needed to level up a bit more in this area. I know it can be done, but I didn't want to get stuck on one piece, and this could be triaged. I ended up animating one koi in a circle around the world origin point and another koi swimming back-and-forth below the camera.\n\nAdditionally, I found a model with a cluster of fish animating around its local coordinates. I threw them into a bubble and made them circle the origin as well. Admittedly, the animation loop is not seamless, and I'd love to import the file to Blender to (1) level up my skills there and, of course, (2) fix the animation loop.\n\n### Other Objects\n\nAside from the fish models, I added a rotating lily pad as a pseudo \"floor\" or base under the camera. It provides a visual barrier for the kois to pass under and create visual interest. There is also a floating island and treasure chest off to one side, again for visual interest.\n\nEverything in the scene is largely experimental and \"why not\" with the goal to add incremental complexity and practice loading assets. It's *not* how I usually like doing things, but it's sufficient to experiment and implement.\n\n## Credits\n\nThe following are links to the assets I downloaded and the model artists responsible for these great (free) resources.

Great and jubilant thanks to Bruno Simon and the rest of the Three.js Journey community for their feedback, encouragement, and kudos!\n\n**My biggest takeaways** during this project:\n\n- focus on a core idea, implement that, and grow out naturally from there (especially for these challenges)\n- free models are great, but don't forget the agency Blender (et al.) provides to customize/tweak details\n- if you're going to stretch for some feature (sweet shaders, epic models, etc.) be sure you \n\u003Cbr>(A) budget your time wisely or \n\u003Cbr>(B) prioritize features\n\nIf/when I make updates to the project, I'll update this post as well.\n\nKeep learning, keep growing, folks!","src/content/blog/threejs-journey-challenge19-aquarium.md",[747,748],"./images/tjsj-019-aquarium.png","./images/tjsj-019-surreal-aquarium.png","5f502e2d8953ce7d",{"html":751,"metadata":752},"\u003Ch1 id=\"threejs-journey-august-25-challenge-aquarium\">Three.js Journey August ‘25 Challenge: Aquarium\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>I began the Three.js Journey course in May 2025.

After trying a few iterations, I concluded I needed to level up a bit more in this area. I know it can be done, but I didn’t want to get stuck on one piece, and this could be triaged. I ended up animating one koi in a circle around the world origin point and another koi swimming back-and-forth below the camera.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Additionally, I found a model with a cluster of fish animating around its local coordinates. I threw them into a bubble and made them circle the origin as well.

I have fallen behind on my updates. Today was the review day for October's challenge. [Let's finish the updates.](#update-nov-4)\n\n## Brainstorming\n\nWith the theme being \"Cozy Place,\" I began with brain dumping a lot of cozy place ideas: libraries, cozy reading nooks, big fluffy beds, etc. I briefly also considered how it could be made into a game, but then I remembered I'm a noob at this process and don't have 40 hours a week (or even half that probably) to dedicate to a month-long project. Gotta lock down that scope creep good and early.\n\nI went to one of my go-tos for ideas: [Pinterest](https://pinterest.com). Although it's polluted these days with ads and AI-generated material, it's the AI-generated concept art that I find most helpful. I searched \"cozy\" and took it away from there. I also searched \"cozy\" synonyms, etymology, and definitions for branching and adjacent ideas.\n\nI eventually came to a fun chat discussion with ChatGPT for idea iteration. I prompted it to spit out some ideas at the surface level for my consideration, then I added some fun curve balls like \"give me more fantasy themes.\" That spun off into oblique sci-fi ideas. I also had it contrast ironic themes.\n\nUltimately, I ended on an idea that's very \"me\" as my wife quipped: a spaceship reading nook with books and shelves all around. The \"cozy\" theme is met with the comfy chair surrounded by books and beautiful nature scenery (i.e. background space scene). The irony came in with the dramatic contrast of being in a wildly hostile environment (space) with a cozy spot to read. The idea \"cozy\" implies safety, security, and warmth, all of which are antithetical to the dangerous, hostile cold of space. I love it.\n\n## Composition\n\nWith my theme and idea refined, I set out to thumbnail composition ideas. I know it's going to be a chill, contemplative scene (like [my previous challenge](./threejs-journey-challenge19-aquarium) but less surreal).\n\nI also know I *really* want to build a reusable system/function for gently adjusting the camera in Three.js based on my mouse movements. This would give some subtle interaction with the scene, but keep the user focused on the main \"cozy place.\" I read a great article once for indie game devs suggesting they should build reusable systems instead of minigames as a way to learn. I'll post that here if I find the link again. It inspired me to isolate my own reusable systems for Three.js so projects like this go faster & smoother.\n\nIn my undergrad (Bachelor of Fine Arts in Digital Art), I learned the great value of forcing yourself to thumbnail ideas, especially when it comes to composition. The first 10 ideas are often pretty basic and common. Creativity usually comes when you push past your comfort zone and keep dreaming up ideas. I didn't do as many past 10, but that's when I started getting ideas I really liked. Unfortunately, some of those ideas are mighty ambitious for a new creative developer (i.e. Three.js and Blender are still new enough I can't stretch as far as I'd like).\n\nI began asking myself, \"which of these still captures 'cozy place'\" with the elements I want but is practical given I might only have 6-8 hours a week to work on it?\n\n![Cozy Thumbnails](./images/tjsj-020-cozy-thumbnails.jpg)\n\n(I've got to get my blog images under control. Good grief.)\n\nIn the middle row, you'll notice a star with 1, 2, and 3. While star 3 looks really cool, I wanted to tackle a room I was more confident in modeling first. The room needn't be flawless all around. The viewer will only catch this corner of it. However, it'll accomplish what I need.\n\n## Modeling\n\nI did a lot of work with Maya in my undergrad, and Blender shares many similarities with Maya, but they are very different too. I've tried learning Blender **many** times, but my muscle memory for navigating Maya has been so strong and my use cases so few that I've never really taken off with it. I know the controls can be configured to mirror Maya, but that messes with tutorials as I do them. I'd prefer to learn Blenders defaults.\n\nI pulled up some Blender tutorials this time around and did a few demos on the side to get a feel for how to make complex models with a few simple commands. **Pro noob tip:** search for \"N things I wish I knew in Blender\" as a source for good tips.\n\nI started this modeling approach (right or wrong) by making a rectangle/box and using the loop tool to add some edges I would preserve. I then inset and extruded until I got what looked like windows. I would *like* to get some glass/window textures in place for those so my cozy reading spot isn't exposed to the decompressing vacuum of the near-infinite void, but we'll get to that later.\n\nI also hunted around until I found a great model (TODO give credit to model artist). I tweaked the size and orientation, then dropped it into my room, imported them into my code, *et voila*! I have a room corner with a chair!\n\n![First Room Chair](./images/tjsj-020-first-room-chair.png)\n\n### Update Oct 13\n\n![Room with chair, side table, and mug](./images/tjsj-020-cozy-room-oct13.jpg)\n\n**I've expanded the modeling a lot.** I didn't like how the composition pinched the chair position, and I wanted taller shelves for my books than what the windows were allowing. I removed a window and threw a large book shelf with many books up. The Array modifier in Blender helped significantly with both the construction of the shelves *and* the multiplication of the books. (I created one book, used the Array mod to fill one shelf, then used the Array mod 2 more times to fill out each shelf along the X and Z axes [b/c Z is \"up\" in Blender]). I'd like to vary the book textures as a stretch goal, but this is sufficient for now.\n\nI also added a rug to lighten up the scene (thanks [Wayfair](https://www.wayfair.com/rugs/pdp/ebern-designs-zuhur-area-rug-w110736589.html?piid=1967988449)); most of the objects are espresso, my favorite \"wood color,\" or a dark leather. Additionally, a floor lamp was added behind the chair to also *lighten up the room*. Eh?? EHHH???? Okay, that's enough.\n\nI just tonight (Oct 13) finished up adding a side table and hot drink mug. The mug is pretty low poly, but it's far enough away not to notice. Another stretch goal will be to get the scene just right, then start degrading the poly counts and see how far down I can tweak things to lighten the assets.\n\n### Update Nov 4\n\nNot much changed with the models by the end. My fake environment map (truthfully just a large sphere - sub par but sufficient for the time) was added with its beautiful texture. (Credits coming soon.)\n\nOne excellent adjustment per my lovely wife's suggestion was to rotate and enlarge the carpet to run in front of the book shelf. Solid advise and it looks much better that way. Admittedly, the right side of the scene seems a bit barren now, but that was acceptable given the view outside.\n\n## Lighting\n\nLighting was finally improved, though not substantially. I tweaked the main point light, removed the ambient light, and used the background sphere's texture map as an environment map for the scene. That allowed me to emit some colors from the texture to improve the actual ambience.\n\nI *did* try mimicking the light from the background sphere, which may have been easier if it were a true environment map. **I tried placing you spot lights at roughly equidistant locations aligned with the background's stars and rotating them in a group synced with the background sphere's rotation.** The main problem was with the room model, which is half a room (2 walls missing behind the camera) to reduce poly counts. However, that also meant extra light in the room from behind. This made the room prohibitively bright.\n\n(Y'know, photos to illustrate my point would be great. I should add those...)\n\nI ended up keeping my tweaked lights as they were. I tried adding shadows, but my model is weird in the corner and caused more shadow issues. Additionally, I wanted to avoid expensive shadow rendering all over, so I fake baked a shadow for under the chair and side table.\n\n## Background Music\n\nI added some chill background tunes (Erik Satie's \"Gymnopédies\"). After I added it, I discovered what \"click gates\" do for immersive scenes like this: user interaction. If audio loads without user interaction, the audio won't play (in some browsers) to avoid annoying autoplay music/sound.\n\nBy adding a \"click gate\" (overlay the user clicks to enter the scene), they implicitly opt in to playing audio. Of course, controls must be added for those wishing to silence the scene, which I added.\n\n## Special Effects\n\nOne of my favorite parts (that also turned out to be quite fast thanks to [Three.js Journey's Cofee Smoke Shader lesson](https://threejs-journey.com/lessons/coffee-smoke-shader)) is my \"hot drink\" steam effect.\n\nFunny story: I was only 2 lessons behind it in the Shaders section when I stumbled upon it via searching. I was tickled to discover the lesson was so close and I already had access!\n\nIt's not one of my favorite features and an inspiration for me to continue through an admittedly daunting section of Three.js Journey.\n\n## Final Review\n\nBruno started the Twitch live stream, and it went on for 4 hours. The group was very chatty and easily distracted. I received great feedback though. Many notes were things I already wanted to do but ran out of time to implement. It encourages me I'm on the right wavelength.\n\nOne great tip from Bruno was to use an actual environment map for my sky in order to gain the emissive lighting (which includes colors) instead of my hacked approach. Apparently it's a new-ish feature in Three.js to spin the environment map, which I think I looked for but failed to find. I'll have to try again. I want to improve with environment maps and HRDI images (both using and creating my own).\n\nOne other note I overlooked was that my books relative to my drink cup are disproportionate to each other. So easy to miss those details, but I know their value from art projects and perspective drawings. Amazing how those lessons carry over.\n\n**Overall**, I'm quite pleased with how it all turned out. I definitely want to improve the lighting and the room model, but the other details are sufficient for what the project is: another attempt to implement what I've been learning on this awesome Three.js Journey! 😃\n\n![Final Project](./images/tjsj-020-cozy-final.png)\n\n[Check out the final project: Cosmic Cozy.](https://tjsj-cozy.web.app)","src/content/blog/threejs-journey-challenge20-cozy.md",[796,797,798,799],"./images/tjsj-020-cozy-thumbnails.jpg","./images/tjsj-020-first-room-chair.png","./images/tjsj-020-cozy-room-oct13.jpg","./images/tjsj-020-cozy-final.png","c0e10993ec5c005b",{"html":802,"metadata":803},"\u003Ch1 id=\"threejs-journey-october-2025-challenge-20-cozy-place\">Three.js Journey October 2025, Challenge 20: Cozy Place\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>For this challenge, I’ll strive to update this blog post in addition to social posts on my progress.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Updates:\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"#update-oct-13\">Oct 13 Modeling\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Oct 13: \u003Ca href=\"https://tjsj-cozy.web.app/\">public link available\u003C/a>!\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Nov 4:\u003Cbr>\nWell then… I have fallen behind on my updates.

I have a room corner with a chair!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./images/tjsj-020-first-room-chair.png&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;First Room Chair&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"update-oct-13\">Update Oct 13\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./images/tjsj-020-cozy-room-oct13.jpg&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Room with chair, side table, and mug&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>I’ve expanded the modeling a lot.\u003C/strong> I didn’t like how the composition pinched the chair position, and I wanted taller shelves for my books than what the windows were allowing. I removed a window and threw a large book shelf with many books up. The Array modifier in Blender helped significantly with both the construction of the shelves \u003Cem>and\u003C/em> the multiplication of the books. (I created one book, used the Array mod to fill one shelf, then used the Array mod 2 more times to fill out each shelf along the X and Z axes [b/c Z is “up” in Blender]). I’d like to vary the book textures as a stretch goal, but this is sufficient for now.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I also added a rug to lighten up the scene (thanks \u003Ca href=\"https://www.wayfair.com/rugs/pdp/ebern-designs-zuhur-area-rug-w110736589.html?piid=1967988449\">Wayfair\u003C/a>); most of the objects are espresso, my favorite “wood color,” or a dark leather. Additionally, a floor lamp was added behind the chair to also \u003Cem>lighten up the room\u003C/em>. Eh?? EHHH???? Okay, that’s enough.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I just tonight (Oct 13) finished up adding a side table and hot drink mug. The mug is pretty low poly, but it’s far enough away not to notice. Another stretch goal will be to get the scene just right, then start degrading the poly counts and see how far down I can tweak things to lighten the assets.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"update-nov-4\">Update Nov 4\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Not much changed with the models by the end. My fake environment map (truthfully just a large sphere - sub par but sufficient for the time) was added with its beautiful texture. (Credits coming soon.)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One excellent adjustment per my lovely wife’s suggestion was to rotate and enlarge the carpet to run in front of the book shelf. Solid advise and it looks much better that way. Admittedly, the right side of the scene seems a bit barren now, but that was acceptable given the view outside.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"lighting\">Lighting\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Lighting was finally improved, though not substantially. I tweaked the main point light, removed the ambient light, and used the background sphere’s texture map as an environment map for the scene. That allowed me to emit some colors from the texture to improve the actual ambience.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I \u003Cem>did\u003C/em> try mimicking the light from the background sphere, which may have been easier if it were a true environment map. \u003Cstrong>I tried placing you spot lights at roughly equidistant locations aligned with the background’s stars and rotating them in a group synced with the background sphere’s rotation.\u003C/strong> The main problem was with the room model, which is half a room (2 walls missing behind the camera) to reduce poly counts. However, that also meant extra light in the room from behind. This made the room prohibitively bright.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>(Y’know, photos to illustrate my point would be great. I should add those…)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I ended up keeping my tweaked lights as they were. I tried adding shadows, but my model is weird in the corner and caused more shadow issues. Additionally, I wanted to avoid expensive shadow rendering all over, so I fake baked a shadow for under the chair and side table.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"background-music\">Background Music\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I added some chill background tunes (Erik Satie’s “Gymnopédies”). After I added it, I discovered what “click gates” do for immersive scenes like this: user interaction. If audio loads without user interaction, the audio won’t play (in some browsers) to avoid annoying autoplay music/sound.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>By adding a “click gate” (overlay the user clicks to enter the scene), they implicitly opt in to playing audio. Of course, controls must be added for those wishing to silence the scene, which I added.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"special-effects\">Special Effects\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>One of my favorite parts (that also turned out to be quite fast thanks to \u003Ca href=\"https://threejs-journey.com/lessons/coffee-smoke-shader\">Three.js Journey’s Cofee Smoke Shader lesson\u003C/a>) is my “hot drink” steam effect.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Funny story: I was only 2 lessons behind it in the Shaders section when I stumbled upon it via searching. I was tickled to discover the lesson was so close and I already had access!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s not one of my favorite features and an inspiration for me to continue through an admittedly daunting section of Three.js Journey.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"final-review\">Final Review\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Bruno started the Twitch live stream, and it went on for 4 hours. The group was very chatty and easily distracted. I received great feedback though. Many notes were things I already wanted to do but ran out of time to implement. It encourages me I’m on the right wavelength.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One great tip from Bruno was to use an actual environment map for my sky in order to gain the emissive lighting (which includes colors) instead of my hacked approach. Apparently it’s a new-ish feature in Three.js to spin the environment map, which I think I looked for but failed to find. I’ll have to try again. I want to improve with environment maps and HRDI images (both using and creating my own).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One other note I overlooked was that my books relative to my drink cup are disproportionate to each other. So easy to miss those details, but I know their value from art projects and perspective drawings. Amazing how those lessons carry over.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Overall\u003C/strong>, I’m quite pleased with how it all turned out. I definitely want to improve the lighting and the room model, but the other details are sufficient for what the project is: another attempt to implement what I’ve been learning on this awesome Three.js Journey! 😃\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg __ASTRO_IMAGE_=\"{&#x22;src&#x22;:&#x22;./images/tjsj-020-cozy-final.png&#x22;,&#x22;alt&#x22;:&#x22;Final Project&#x22;,&#x22;index&#x22;:0}\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://tjsj-cozy.web.app\">Check out the final project: Cosmic Cozy.\u003C/a>\u003C/p>",{"headings":804,"localImagePaths":835,"remoteImagePaths":836,"frontmatter":788,"imagePaths":837},[805,808,811,814,817,820,823,826,829,832],{"depth":24,"slug":806,"text":807},"threejs-journey-october-2025-challenge-20-cozy-place","Three.js Journey October 2025, Challenge 20: Cozy Place",{"depth":27,"slug":809,"text":810},"brainstorming","Brainstorming",{"depth":27,"slug":812,"text":813},"composition","Composition",{"depth":27,"slug":815,"text":816},"modeling","Modeling",{"depth":37,"slug":818,"text":819},"update-oct-13","Update Oct 13",{"depth":37,"slug":821,"text":822},"update-nov-4","Update Nov 4",{"depth":27,"slug":824,"text":825},"lighting","Lighting",{"depth":27,"slug":827,"text":828},"background-music","Background Music",{"depth":27,"slug":830,"text":831},"special-effects","Special Effects",{"depth":27,"slug":833,"text":834},"final-review","Final Review",[796,797,798,799],[],[796,797,798,799],"threejs-journey-challenge20-cozy.md","home",["Map",841,842,858,859],"about",{"id":841,"data":843,"body":844,"filePath":845,"digest":846,"rendered":847,"legacyId":857},{},"## About Me\n\nMy name is Adam.
