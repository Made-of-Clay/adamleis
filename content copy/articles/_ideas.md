# Article Idea - The Gifted and The Driven

the naturally gifted and the naturally driven (think Azula v Zuko)

one excels seemingly effortlessly, the other chases and grows

upon seeing the pursuit and growth, the naturally gifted should be motivated to grow and keep out of reach while the driven continues the chase. both grow.

# Article Idea - Lessons from Form Fields

lessons learned about form fields this week:
fieldsets can be nested
the dataset tag
the relationships between select/radio and select[multiple]/checkboxes
radios are *never* alone and always in a radio group
checkboxes are frequently in groups, but not always (e.g. "I confirm…" checkboxes)

# Article Idea - The Apologetics of Programming
"The Apologetics of Programming" - #7 of this article (https://medium.com/codex/10-practices-your-director-of-engineering-expects-from-software-engineers-7fcf8823deae) - have a reason for what you do/write/don't write/etc

# Article Idea - The Many Faces of Interfaces
What GUI, API, and developer interface designers have in common - article about common principles in developing usable interfaces and how they can learn from each other.
	not all principle of UI development transfer to API development (or developer interfeace development), but the common overlaps are note-worthy

# Article Idea - Creativity in Programming
Creativity and experimentation in technology: sometimes, you just have to push yourself into ugly and unconventional places and share the results to gain new insights. "Take chances, make mistakes, and get messy!" - Ms Frizzle 

If you don't try a bunch of things on the fringe, you won't discover things the rest of the community wants to use. That's how creativity works.

# Article Idea - React After Vue
Insights from learning React after Vue. (React doesn't have reactive data, it just uses a system of diff checks on given dependencies.) Understanding by-value vs by-reference is really important to get those deps arrays working right. 

The difference in rendering is big too. React functional components, in particular, are just running through a function and building UI. The reason it's good to have the same order of data mutation every time (difficult as it can be w/ lots of async) is because it's easier to reason about. That's also probably a benefit to gruoping related logic in a component. (set the state[s], the memos, the effects [which run AFTER everything is rendered], and so on)

# Article Idea
Using VR to "experience" different places in the world so as to stretch creativity further. (see article on [Openness & Creativity](https://www.ideatovalue.com/crea/nickskillicorn/2022/03/the-creative-personality-which-of-the-big-5-personality-traits-is-associated-with-creativity))
