# Learning Journal

This Journal section will act as a learning journal for me to record my own thoughts about what I'm learning, the process I'm going through, and any insights or musings on the topics I learn. The goal is to make it an outlet for a more "active learning" mindset where I intentionally take notes on my topics of study.

It differs from [the Notes section](../notes) in that the notes will be more incomplete, highlighted content from whatever the notes from from. This Learning Journal, by contrast, will hold more complete thoughts that come from me, as opposed to quotes or paraphrases from what I'm studying.

#TODO figure out how to properly link to other pages
