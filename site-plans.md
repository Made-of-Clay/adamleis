# Site Plans for AdamLeis.com
I need to rough out some ideas as to what this site will be doing. Currently, I just need it to present some basic info about me, my education and background, some quick work history, and my current gig. Maybe link to social media in footer?

## Site Structure
The following is my rough idea for site structure (static pages, possible dynamic pages, etc...):

- Home
- About Me
- Contact - Might make contact form available in the footer?
- Projects - List of (organized) projects to visit?
    - Web Apps
        - Marvel Calculator
        - Other things
    - Websites (? what's still up that's worth showing?...)
    - WIP Ideas - Project I have plans for in the future
- Blog
    - Possibly organize by tag, category, etc? Need to understand VuePress better

### Alternative Structure
The main page has possible large sections (photo backgrounds?) of Hero Banner (fam and me?).

About section comes next with about info.

Contact form in footer (across whole site w/ social media links). Form submits to simple server endpoint which validates and sends email. Figure out CAPTCHA somehow.

- Projects - List of (organized) projects to visit? Only top level pages will show; more links there.
    - Web Apps
        - Marvel Calculator
        - Other things
    - Websites (? what's still up that's worth showing?...)
    - WIP Ideas - Project I have plans for in the future
- Blog
    - Possibly organize by tag, category, etc? Need to understand VuePress better

## Theme Ideas
Should be simple enough to focus on (text) content, but interesting enough to show design interests. Maybe incorporate subtle tech imagery in background?

Consider using Tailwind for custom theme. It needs added to viewpress as postcss plugin.

## Other VuePress Sites
The following are sites to consider for design/structure inspiration:

- [VuePress Gallery](https://vuepress.gallery/)
- [Jaime Jones](https://jai.me/speaking)
