## About Me

My name is Adam. I've been a professional web developer since 2010 (oh dang, {years} years). I started as a full stack developer in the early days of jQuery and pre-JS renaissance of the mid-teens. I then shifted to managing/building commercial WordPress websites for a few years. After that is when I discovered my love of the front-end focus and building UIs. (Don't get me wrong, back-end work can be fun, but when I can stay out of databases and server configurations, I'm happiest.)

Currently, my favorite things about web today are UI-building ([Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for the win!), animations with both CSS and JS, interactive SVGs, and the amazing things that can be done with WebGL. The super stars platformed at [awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/) are great examples of the type of bleeding-edge work I aspire to master. 

*Update*: I've since learned the term for this: **creative developer**. It taps into the skills and tooling knowledge I gained back in my undergrad and appeals to an ever-present itch to be creative with computers.

On this site, if I'm consistent and following the plan, you'll find some of the content focuses on web development and web-tech adjacent topics, but you'll also likely find other postings on topics I find interesting. Time is always the limiting factor, and I'm not willing to trade time where I should be with my wife as a good husband or sons as a good father, so posts may be less frequent than I'd like, but I'll do my best.

Please reach out through [my social media](#bottom) to engage! I appreciate your thoughtful feedback where applicable.
