**Welcome!** This site acts as my personal blog and portfolio. The various topics of interest I plan on exploring here range from web development, experimental web tech, technology in general, philosophy, religion, science, and more. Poke around and feel free to reach out.

<mark>[Relaunch Note:]</mark> this site is a work-in-progress. I've been struggling getting it relaunched due to the ebb-and-flow of life. I'm going to keep refining it and improving various features. I needed an MVP to just get something out there again. Don't judge. Orâ€¦ do judge, but be constructively critical and give me good notes.
