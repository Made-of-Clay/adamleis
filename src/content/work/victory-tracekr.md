# Victorious!

This fun project is my ["Victory Tracker" application](https://victorious.adamleis.com/). Built back in 2020 (and perhaps in need of some updates), I built it to track my gaming friend group's history of victories and games played. (It's not often I view it on an extra large screen, and as I see it now for writing this post, I notice it has room for improvement. It never ends, does it? ðŸ™‚)

Using Firebase for storage and authentication, and Vuetify + Vue for the UI, we enter our game history and can view victory and player stats over the years of our games.
