# KONA

**tl;dr:** This is not a public web app.

Working at Rosenboom, I focused primarily on bolstering the front-end of the web application, which was using jQuery UI at the time.

While working on KONA, I became more familiar with the business logic and back-end setup to the point where I could support more back-end work. It started out on Code Igniter and eventually transitioned to Phalcon PHP. The front-end was built using jQuery UI and eventually shifted to Vue.js and Webpack for the build step.

The KONA application was a platform for multiple sub-applications that ran within; Part Tracker, Employee Tracker, Job Tracker, and others lived within KONA. The following is a collection of screenshots I grabbed before I had to leave (due to COVID-related layoffs).

The app list showed all of the apps that a user had access to. The apps were grouped alphabetically and a filter is available for quickly finding apps. Apps could be saved by a given user into groups as a sibling tab of the app list.
