# Green Eggs & Ham Word Counter - Vanilla JS

**tl;dr:** [see my *Green Eggs & Ham* play project](https://play.adamleis.com/geh-js/)

I've begun a project series centered around counting the words from the classic Dr. Seuss book *Green Eggs & Ham*. It's quite simple: count how many words are in the book, and display them in a table of some kind. Extra points for providing sorting controls.

This can be done with any medium. I'm starting with web, because it's what I know. Vanilla JS is the simplest (for me) approach, and I can make it look nice. Well, as nice as an eye-scorching burn orange can be.

Future instances of the project will play with different delivery UIs: Python for CLI, Go for server-rendered web page, etc.

Iterating on the same idea with slight variations of tech implementation will allow me to focus on the differences for learning purposes (e.g. learning a new language, framework, environment, etc.).

If you're interested in trying to for yourself, [go to the site](https://play.adamleis.com/geh-js/). If you want to get started on your own project, [fork my repo](https://github.com/Made-of-Clay/geh-read).

Either way, enjoy, and hit me up on the socials. Happy building.
