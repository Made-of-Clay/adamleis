While semantic Versioning (semver) is primarily used for software versioning, it can plausibly be applied to design and graphic changes as well. First, consider the pattern in software; remember that version numbers increment for different reasons.

## Semver in Software

1. **Major:** _incompatible changes_ are made in the software, such as major feature additions or changes that may break backward compatibility.
2. **Minor:** _backward-compatible functionality_ is added to the software, such as new features or enhancements.
3. **Patch:** backward-compatible bug fixes or adjustments (e.g., text changes) are applied to the software.

You can [read more about these and other details](https://semver.org/), but this is sufficient for now.

## Semver in Design

The idea is roughly the same. Major changes to the design should be shown in the major version. Minor and patch versions are the same. But what does it mean for a design to have a major or minor change?

Software version tracking is useful for the consumers of that software. The same is true for designs: changes to the design are most relevant for consumers of the design, e.g., business unit members, developers, or designers making a 2nd set of designs that rely on the 1st (think "style guide" and the branding materials that depend on it).
