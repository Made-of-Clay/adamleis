# Coming Soon: Projects & Experiments

As mentioned on [the home page](/), I'm just trying to get an MVP up for my site to keep delivering. I expect life will keep happening and my intended release timeline & schedule will not unfold as desired.

That being said, I know I need to get some *sizzle* on my site to showcase work I've done, projects I've worked on, things I'm tinkering with, and so on. In short, if this site will do anything for me professionally, it needs proof that I've learned things in 14ish years of professional web development.

Any fool can drop jargon about React, components, and state management in a single-page application using a component-based UI. Or wtf `$('.card').next()` means and does. (Remember when jQuery was the defacto answer context on Stack?)

Anyways, I am going to be getting some work posted where I demonstrate I *have* been making things and *can* make modern applications. I will also drag out and parade around projects that are clearly very dated just by looking at the source. (If you'd like to get some teasers on my abandoned project graveyard, [check out my GitHub](https://github.com/Made-of-Clay). There's even some living projects left over there, though the state of their maintenance is questionable at best.)

Check back soon or reach out on social media to peer pressure me to get my act together.
