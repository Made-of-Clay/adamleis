# Creativity Notes

Initial framework:
- **craft**: the process of how to make something (e.g. mixing paint, writing sheet music, writing words in a poem)
- **design**: the process of organizing the components of the work in an aesthetically pleasing manner
- **art**: the process of imbuing the work with meaning, purpose, and/or value

## Questions to Answer

- How does this framework fit with other uses of the term "creative"? (e.g. entrepreneurial, technical, generic problem-solving [think "MacGyver"])
- How do other frameworks like Aristotle's Modes of Persuasion or Four Causes compare and help readers understand what the framework is trying to do?
- How does the *art* portion handle the wild subjectivity of art that's common today?
- What is the thesis?
- What sets this view apart from others? (What are other views?)
- What examples can I give to illustrate the utility of the framework?
- How, if at all, can I connect emotionally w/ the audience? ðŸ¤¨
- Can any action steps be identified in the closing?

## Structure

1. Intro
   - "This post is the first in a series explaining this three-part view of creativity."
   - "Frameworks help creators, viewers, and critics consider objects of study in relatively consistent ways. Without shared guidelines, the risk of talking past each other lurks around each topic."
   - Thesis: This three-part framework provides a multifaceted way to look at creative work by considering the work's craft, design, and artistic meaning.
   - Brief Outline
2. Each Concept w/ Description
   - Craft: how you build the creative work; examples:
     - painting: mix paint, use brush/knife, prime canvas
     - musical composition: timing, playing in-key, proper finger position
     - pottery: water-to-clay mixture, throwing technique, glazing
   - Design: how you arrange the components to be aesthetically appealing; examples:
     - painting: composition, weight, proportion, rhythm, color theory
     - musical composition: chord progressions, major/minor progressions, modal interchange
     - pottery: the overall shape of the pot, colors used during glazing, form that facilitates function
   - Art: how the work conveys a message or is imbued with meaning; examples:
     - painting: hierarchical relationships conveyed through size, metaphorical symbols, narratives displayed in a single image
     - musical composition: subtle metaphorical elements, booming crescendos signifying great action, little flourishes simulating frolicking
3. Examples: how the framework compares to great creative
4. Teaser for next post (criticisms, maybe more in-depth analysis of topics)
5. Conclusion

Remember:
- use formatting
- use lists (summarizing bullet points)
- use visuals w/ captions
- maybe TOC
