This series covers a framework of thinking for the many facets of creativity.

At the beginning of this "project" of sorts, I will begin by outlining the 
framework and its parts, then I will explore ways that it can be applied to both
the common and the less-obvious domains of creativity.

I also intend to steel-man arguments *against* the view in an effort to test it
and identify its weaknesses (in an effort to identify how it can be bolstered).
