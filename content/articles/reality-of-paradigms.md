# The Reality of Paradigms

-- rough outline --

Paradigms/archetypes are more than real. They are the standard against which things are measured to determine their "realness."

Paradigm/archetype - standard of something
subject - thing being measured
value - level of adherence to the standard
potential - conditionally attainable value for adherence to the paradigm
actual - already-attained value to the paradigm

The reason the paradigm/archetype is more than real is because the reality of something (amount to which something has been actualized) depends fundamentally on the paradigm to which it is measured.

TODO find some examples to illustrate this more than just abstract taxonomy
