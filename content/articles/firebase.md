# Firebase Hosting

I just want to rant for a moment on how great Firebase Hosting really is. In just a short evening, using the multisite feature (where you can add many sites to the same project), I've been able to revive a few of my previously subdomained web projects. It has been *so* nice just throwing it together, running a few commands, *et voila*, the sites work.

Maybe I can go into more detail sharing my notes on what I've done with it so far in case someone else can benefit from it. As for now, I just needed to spit these thoughts out.
