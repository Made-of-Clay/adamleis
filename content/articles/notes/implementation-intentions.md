# Implementation Intentions

A video on YouTube by *Better Than Yesterday* had an interesting video called "[How To Actually Get Things Done (implementation intentions)](https://youtu.be/DUAB-BW-gZ8)" - these are my notes for the video.

Three groups asked to exercise:

1. Control group - only track exercise
2. Motivated group - track & get pep talk before
3. Recording group - 1 & 2 but also write what/where/when exercised

Success rates: 1 @ 38%, 2 @ 35%, 3 @ 91%

## If-Then Plan

Goals become more practical when thought through and planned more. "I want to achieve X → If Y, then X." All guess work is removed, ergo, **the plan is more effective**.

Using exercise example: exercise 3x per week → If it's Friday 5pm, then I'll exercise.

### Incorporating **Coping Plans** bolsters If-Then Plans.

> If obstacle Y occurs, then I will do X to overcome it. ([5:24](https://youtu.be/DUAB-BW-gZ8?t=324))

Plans for obstacles and prepares solutions before hand.

Another study cited cardiac rehab patients w/ roughly same amount of practice (in minutes). After rehab, the tracked patients dropped off in their practice. The implementation intention patients increased slightly, but the coping plan patients rocketed foreword in training time.

> … mere motivation isn't enough for us to take action.

It's also often better to begin doing something you're not motivated to do even if what you commit to doing sounds trivial. "I'll only work on cleaning the bowls," easily turns into doing most of the dishes.

This works because (1) you overcome the obstacle of starting. It's harder to start than to keep going. (2) It's also an instance of following a coping plan, e.g. if I don't feel like doing it, I will do at least some of it.
