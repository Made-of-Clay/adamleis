# Notes

As a brief explanation, this "Notes" section of my blog is really more for me than anyone else (but why not share? ðŸ˜‰) - It differs from [the Journal section](../journal/) in that the notes will be more choppy and incomplete sentences, whereas the journal entries will have slightly more complete thoughts (even if it does tend towards the stream-of-consciousness style of writing).

Honest session: it'll also help me increase the diversity of content as I continue developing the blog and understanding what it will need better. Who knew blogs were easier to plan out and build when there was content to plan around!? ðŸ¤”

All of this content *is* still my original content, even when I'm quoting from my sources, which I'll link to in the notes themselves.
