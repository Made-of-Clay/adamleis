# Nuxt Blog

So I've been trying to redo my website as a Nuxt blog. I like Nuxt; it's a powerful tool for sure. I am definitely a novice (currently) as I work through things, but that's not a problem. Realistically, what's a problem right now is my rush to get something together and put it up online. I *know* the value and importance of planning things out, taking the right steps to make sure it all makes sense so I don't waste my time. I do know this, but for some reason, it's always harder to practice when it's your own project.

I've been waffling back and forth on whether or not to have a "categories" and "tags" section for my articles. I think my range of posts will be far-reaching enough to warrant that kind of organization. One day, I might post some stream-of-consciousness thing like this article about Nuxt, web stuff, or Unreal Engine. These kinds of journal brain-dumps are loosely intended to chronicle my process learning various different things. I suspect I will be able to organize things better once I get more content in here, but for now, I am almost paralyzed, stuck between "make it organized" and "just write the dang thing." I know the solution is to take a step back, think through what I fundamentally need based on what I know *right now,* and build with the expectation it will change.

Another snag I'm caught on is how much I should or should not couple my fundamental design pieces of the site to Nuxt. It's always possible, probable really, that I'll stumble across something else one day and want to redo my site *again.* Then again, I notice in my advancing years that I'm decreasingly interested in chasing every fad that's out and instead just nailing something down and being content with it. I wonder what it is about age that does that. Maybe people just get tired of chasing the wind, or they get wise enough to realize the value in solid principles and can ignore the shiny veneer of "what's hot."

All of this is to say, I will be expanding onto this blog post with more stream-of-consciousness updates to share what I've discovered, what I find interesting, etcâ€¦ Perhaps it will grow enough that it'll warrant a refactor into a section rather than a single page. *Or* I'll split them up into multiple posts with the same *tags* and group them that way. (Ehh?! See what I did there?)

Thanks for playing, mysterious reader.
